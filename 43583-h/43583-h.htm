<br /><i>The Burnt Bungalow</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;For the whole month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane Patterson&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with anticipation
as she repeated the invitation her chum had
just extended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise Gay. &ldquo;You see,
we never could invite you before, because the
bungalow is so small, and there&rsquo;s just room
enough for our own family. But Dad will be
out West all of August. He doesn&rsquo;t expect to
be back until Labor Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a case?&rdquo; inquired Jane, for Mr. Gay
was a detective on the police force.</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. An important one. I almost wish I
could go with him&mdash;it sounds so thrilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you have enough excitement and
mystery at Dark Cedars?&rdquo; demanded Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never have enough,&rdquo; returned the other girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, please don&rsquo;t dig up anything to spoil
our vacation at Shady Nook. Still, I don&rsquo;t really
suppose you could if you tried. The very name
implies peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a peaceful spot,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Not a bit like a big summer resort. Just the
mountains and the woods and the lovely Hudson
River. Only half a dozen bungalows, so
that everybody knows everybody else. It&rsquo;s all so
friendly and nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shan&rsquo;t need any fancy clothes&mdash;like
dance dresses?&rdquo; Jane&rsquo;s tone held a faint note of
disappointment. She loved outdoor sports, but
she was equally fond of parties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better take a couple along,&rdquo; replied the
other girl. &ldquo;Across the river from Shady Nook
there&rsquo;s a big modern hotel where we often go
for dinners and dances. Everybody wears their
best clothes there. But most of the time we eat
at Flicks&rsquo; Inn. It&rsquo;s just a bigger bungalow,
where they have a dining room for the Shady
Nook people and a few boarders. Very nice and
informal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane jumped up and started down the steps,
across the lawn that separated the Gays&rsquo; house
from the Pattersons&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go tell Mother all about it,&rdquo; she explained,
&ldquo;and begin to get my clothing ready.
What time do we start?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seven o&rsquo;clock tomorrow morning. Rain or
shine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Left alone, Mary Louise opened the screen
door and went into her own house. Her father,
with his suitcase on the floor beside him, was
saying good-bye to her mother and to his young
son Joseph, whom everybody called &ldquo;Freckles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay put his hand upon his daughter&rsquo;s
shoulder and said to his wife:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am counting on Mary Louise to take care
of you, dear. After the way she mastered that
situation at Dark Cedars, I feel that she is capable
of almost anything. Far above and beyond
most girls of sixteen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is!&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Gay proudly. &ldquo;But I
am not expecting any trouble at Shady Nook.
I&rsquo;m more worried about what may happen to
you before you catch those criminals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; her husband assured her.
&ldquo;Wire for me if you need me&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll come
back by airplane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay nodded, little thinking that she
would have to follow his advice before the
month was over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>As soon as he was gone, the other three members
of the family returned to the business of
packing. Silky, Mary Louise&rsquo;s little brown
spaniel, trotted around after them, sniffing at
everything and looking serious and important,
as if he were doing most of the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful your father left us the car,&rdquo;
remarked Mrs. Gay, as the suitcases and packages
were piled up near the back door. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shady Nook is so far from the Junction,&rdquo;
added Mary Louise. &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re lucky. And
isn&rsquo;t it nice I have my license, so you won&rsquo;t have
to drive all the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; agreed her mother. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
always been a big help to me, Mary Louise. And
so have you, Freckles,&rdquo; she added to the boy.</p>
<p>At last everything was finished, in time to
allow them all a good sleep before their trip.
Shady Nook was almost a day&rsquo;s journey from
Riverside, if they took it in a leisurely manner,
driving slowly enough to enjoy the beautiful
Hudson River, and stopping at noon at some
pleasant inn to eat lunch and rest.</p>
<p>Jane was on hand early, helping the Gays to
stack the luggage in the back seat and on the
rack provided at the rear of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to leave a corner for Silky!&rdquo;
Freckles reminded the girls, &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be left
behind!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As if I could forget him!&rdquo; returned his sister,
picking up the little spaniel and giving him a
hug. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he save our lives that night we rode
in Harry Grant&rsquo;s car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane shuddered; she could never forget the
horror of that dark night or the terror she had
experienced when the tramp commanded,
&ldquo;Hands up!&rdquo; Good old Silky, biting a piece out
of the thug&rsquo;s leg while the girls made their
escape!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s driving first?&rdquo; she asked, as the last
bundle was stored away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; answered Mary Louise. &ldquo;You and
Silky in front with me, and Mother and Freckles
in back. We&rsquo;ll shift places after lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a lovely clear day, not so hot as it often
is in August, and the whole party was in the gayest
of spirits. Mary Louise loved to drive, and
she did it well. She would not have minded if
she had been kept at the wheel all day.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after their pleasant lunch at a
quaint little tea room on the roadside, she was
perfectly willing to exchange places with her
mother and enjoy the better opportunity to look
at the scenery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Jane, however, was more interested in Shady
Nook than in the country through which they
were passing. She asked innumerable questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many bungalows did you say there are,
Mary Lou?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were six last year, counting Flicks&rsquo;
Inn. But I understand that there were two new
ones put up this spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are there plenty of young people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so many at the cottages, but it doesn&rsquo;t
matter, because we have just as much fun with
the middle-aged people. Everybody swims and
paddles and dances and plays tennis. Besides,
there are always extra young people boarding
at Flicks&rsquo; for shorter vacations. And sometimes
we meet the people at the Royal Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that where they hold the dances?&rdquo; inquired
Jane. &ldquo;When we wear our flossy dresses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That&rsquo;s the place. Across the river from
Shady Nook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me some of the people&rsquo;s names,&rdquo; urged
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, next door to us&mdash;only it really isn&rsquo;t
next door, because there&rsquo;s quite a little woods
between&mdash;is the loveliest cottage at Shady Nook.
It was built by a man named Hunter, who was
very rich. He bought all the land around there
on our side of the river and sold it to people he
knew and liked. But he died last year, so only his
wife and son came back this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A son?&rdquo; repeated Jane, rolling her eyes. &ldquo;Not
a babe in arms, I hope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sophomore at Yale,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Rather homely, but awfully nice&mdash;and piles of
fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the youth&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go! Putting him down in your
notebook already! His name&rsquo;s Clifford. We all
call him Cliff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally. But if he&rsquo;s your property, Mary
Lou, just say the word, and I&rsquo;ll keep off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s my special property,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Not even Max Miller,&rdquo; she added, mentioning
her particular boy-friend in their home town of
Riverside. &ldquo;Though he sometimes acts as if he
believed I were his! I like Cliff Hunter a lot&mdash;everybody
does. But we don&rsquo;t pair off much at
Shady Nook, except sometimes to go canoeing.
Most of the time we&rsquo;re just one big family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else are there besides the Hunters?&rdquo; inquired
the other girl. &ldquo;I mean, what other families
with young people?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Reeds are about the jolliest family at
Shady Nook,&rdquo; answered Mary Louise. &ldquo;There
are five children, and the father and mother are
just as much fun as the kids. The two oldest girls&mdash;Sue
and Mabel&mdash;are twins about our age.
Seventeen, I believe, to be exact. Then there are
two younger boys that Freckles chums up with,
and a little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll never be able to keep all those
names straight,&rdquo; sighed Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till we get there and you meet them one
at a time,&rdquo; advised the other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so much easier
to remember people after you&rsquo;ve seen them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This advice sounded sensible, and Jane settled
back in her corner to enjoy the remainder of the
ride. The time passed quickly; at five o&rsquo;clock
they crossed the railroad junction and turned
into the private road that led to Shady Nook.</p>
<p>The trees were thick on one side of the road,
but on the other they could see the lovely Hudson
River, gleaming blue in the August sunlight.
Jane went into ecstasies over the beauty of
the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are!&rdquo; announced Mrs. Gay as she
turned off to a dirt driveway and brought the
car to a stop at a tin garage. &ldquo;Our back door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re right in the woods!&rdquo; cried Jane,
still unable to see the Gays&rsquo; cottage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you see the bungalow!&rdquo; returned
Mary Louise. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a little dream house. You
can borrow it for your honeymoon, if you like&mdash;provided
you don&rsquo;t get married in the summer
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks a lot! But I think I&rsquo;ll wait a few years
before I accept your kind offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another moment they were all out of the
car, following Mrs. Gay around to the front of
the cottage, up to the screened porch, from
which they had a good view of the river.</p>
<p>As Mary Louise had said, the bungalow was
charming. Built entirely of logs, it combined the
picturesqueness of olden times with the conveniences
of the modern day. A huge fireplace covered
one entire wall of the living room, and the
chairs were big and soft and comfortable. A
drop-leaf table at one end of the room was sometimes
used for meals, because there was no dining
room. But the spotless kitchen contained a
breakfast nook where the Gays always ate their
first meal of each day. Two bedrooms branched
off from the living room, with a white bathroom
between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little bit too civilized for me,&rdquo; said
Freckles, in a most superior manner. &ldquo;I sleep out
back in a tent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In good weather,&rdquo; amended Mrs. Gay.
&ldquo;Now, girls, suppose we just unpack one suitcase
apiece and get ready for dinner. We&rsquo;re going
over to Flicks&rsquo;, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got to have a swim!&rdquo; announced Freckles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, if you&rsquo;ll be quick about it. And
don&rsquo;t go in all by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The group gathered together again at half-past
six and started down the private road to
Flicks&rsquo; Inn, where they would have their supper.
Mary Louise and Jane had both put on light
summer dresses and looked as rested and refreshed
as if they had been at Shady Nook all
summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is our next-door neighbor&rsquo;s cottage?&rdquo;
inquired Jane, peering through the trees
on the road. &ldquo;Or do the Hunters live on the other
side of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the Reeds live on the other side. Theirs
is the last bungalow. The Hunters&rsquo; is right in
here.&rdquo; She paused at a path between two big oak
trees.</p>
<p>Jane stepped to her side and looked in among
the foliage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been burnt down!&rdquo; cried Freckles, dashing
up behind the girls. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have a chance
to tell you. About a week ago, Larry Reed said.
Awful mysterious. In the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burned down!&rdquo; repeated Mary Louise, rushing
in through the trees beside the path. &ldquo;Honestly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See for yourself!&rdquo; replied her brother.</p>
<p>A few steps more, and they saw for themselves
that it was only too true. The blackened trunks,
the dry, scarred grass, and the faint smoky odor
confirmed his statement. The beautiful cottage
was gone forever. Nothing remained but the
charred stones of its foundation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, don&rsquo;t I wish I&rsquo;d been here!&rdquo; exclaimed
Freckles regretfully. &ldquo;It must have been some
fire. But they say nobody saw it. It was practically
out when they discovered it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky that it was!&rdquo; said Mrs. Gay. &ldquo;Suppose
ours had caught too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise shuddered; such an idea was too
dreadful to contemplate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know any of the details, Freckles?&rdquo;
asked his mother, as the party turned back to
the road again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. Nobody does. It just happened,
at night, while everybody was over at a dance at
the Royal Hotel across the river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll hear more about it at Flicks&rsquo;.
Come on, let&rsquo;s hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed one bungalow on the way to the
inn, which Mary Louise pointed out to Jane as
belonging to the Partridges&mdash;all middle-aged
people, she explained&mdash;so that her chum was not
interested. Nobody over twenty-five was any use
to Jane Patterson.</p>
<p>The inn, a large square frame building, was
completely surrounded by porches on which
tables were placed where people were already
eating their dinners. Of the eight families at
Shady Nook, all except one took their lunches
and suppers at Flicks&rsquo;. Besides them, there were
at least half a dozen boarders. Roughly, Mary
Louise estimated there were about thirty-five
people at the inn.</p>
<p>They all seemed to know the Gays, for everybody
was bowing and smiling as the little party
opened the screen door of the front porch.</p>
<p>Mrs. Flick, a fat, good-natured woman of
about fifty, came forward to welcome them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, it&rsquo;s good to see you all back again!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, with genuine pleasure. &ldquo;But where
is Mr. Gay?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He had to go to California on business,&rdquo; explained
Mrs. Gay. &ldquo;So we brought Mary
Louise&rsquo;s friend, Jane Patterson, in his place.
Mrs. Flick, this is Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy to meet you, Miss Jane,&rdquo; returned
the landlady as she led the Gays to their accustomed
table. When they were seated, she pulled
up a chair beside them to talk for a few minutes
with Mrs. Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us about the Hunters&rsquo; bungalow!&rdquo;
begged Mary Louise immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to tell. Nobody knows
much.... Oh, here&rsquo;s Hattie to take your
order.&rdquo; And the newcomers had to exchange
greetings with the waitress, the daughter of a
farmer named Adams who lived a couple of
miles from Shady Nook.</p>
<p>When the order had been given, Mary Louise
repeated her question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened a week ago&mdash;on a Saturday,&rdquo;
explained Mrs. Flick. &ldquo;Mr. Clifford had four
college boys visiting him, and they all went
across the river that evening to a dance at the
Royal Hotel. Mrs. Hunter went along with &rsquo;em.
When they came back, the place was burned to
the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t anybody see the flames&mdash;or smell the
smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. The wind was the other way from the
hotel, and there wasn&rsquo;t anybody at Shady Nook
to notice. Everybody, except Pa and me, went
to the dance. And we were sound asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hattie came back with the soup, and Mrs.
Flick rose from her chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later,&rdquo;
she said as she hurried into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds very mysterious,&rdquo; muttered Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s probably some simple explanation,&rdquo;
replied Jane lightly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to ask
Clifford Hunter. Where is he, Mary Lou? Do
you see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girl glanced hastily about the big
porch and shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;But he may be inside.
There&rsquo;s another dining room in the bungalow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t Clifford?&rdquo; asked Jane, watching
a tall, good-looking, dark-eyed young man coming
out of the door.</p>
<p>Mary Louise turned around and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s David McCall. He usually comes
up just for two weeks&rsquo; vacation and stays here at
Flicks&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>A moment later the young man reached the
Gays&rsquo; table and was introduced to Jane. But he
merely nodded to her briefly: his eyes seemed to
devour Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d never come, Mary Lou!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;A whole week of my vacation is
gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have another week, don&rsquo;t you,
David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. A measly seven days! And then another
year to wait till I see you again!&rdquo; His tone was
not bantering, like the boys at home. David McCall
was serious&mdash;too terribly serious, Mary
Louise sometimes thought&mdash;about everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come over to see you after supper?&rdquo;
he pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise lightly.
&ldquo;And then you can tell us about the fire. You
were here when it happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I didn&rsquo;t get here till Sunday. But I can
tell you something about it, all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes opened wide with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody set it on fire&mdash;on purpose, you
mean, David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man leaned over and whispered in
her ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clifford Hunter himself!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Mary Louise gasped in amazement. &ldquo;But
why?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To collect the insurance!&rdquo; was the surprising
reply.</p>
<p>And, turning about, David McCall went back
into the boarding house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><i>Clifford&rsquo;s Story</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; demanded both Jane and
Freckles the moment David McCall was out of
hearing distance.</p>
<p>Mary Louise leaned forward and lowered her
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said Cliff Hunter set the place on fire
himself&mdash;to get the insurance. Now that his
father is dead, the bungalow belongs to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How awful!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane. &ldquo;Do you believe
that, Mary Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t&mdash;knowing Cliff as I do. Do you,
Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Gay emphatically.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just David&rsquo;s jealousy. He&rsquo;s poor himself,
and he has a sort of grudge against all rich
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; admitted Mary Louise. &ldquo;David
never did like Cliff, all the summers they&rsquo;ve both
been coming up here to Shady Nook.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could meet this young Hunter,&rdquo;
lamented Jane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m keen to get a look at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he isn&rsquo;t here any more,&rdquo; remarked
Mary Louise. &ldquo;Since the bungalow is gone,
where would he stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hunters are living over at the Royal
Hotel, I think,&rdquo; Freckles informed them.
&ldquo;Seems to me that&rsquo;s what Larry Reed said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Cliff will be over to see you,&rdquo; observed
Mrs. Gay confidently.</p>
<p>Her supposition proved correct: no sooner
had the Gays returned to their own bungalow
after supper than a motorboat chugged its way
across the river and anchored at their dock. A
moment later Clifford Hunter stepped out.</p>
<p>As Mary Louise had said, he was not a good-looking
young man. His height was only medium,
and he was so thin that even expensive
tailoring could not make his clothes look well.
But his big nose and his sandy complexion were
offset by a pleasant smile and attractive gray
eyes, which somehow made you feel as if you had
known Cliff Hunter all your life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mary Lou!&rdquo; he called as he came
towards the porch. &ldquo;Heard you were here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He whistled a gay tune as he ascended the
steps, and smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so homely after all,&rdquo; Jane thought as she
looked into his pleasant face. And his white
flannels and dark blue coat were certainly becoming.
They evidently did not wear sweaters
at the Royal Hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; returned Mary Louise. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
dying to hear the news!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo; He shook hands with Mary
Louise and her mother and was introduced to
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Clifford,&rdquo; urged Mrs. Gay.</p>
<p>The young man fumbled in his pocket and
produced a pack of cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a minute, thank you, Mrs. Gay,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;But first&mdash;take a card, Mary Lou. I know
some bully new tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you gotten over that fad yet, Cliff?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>He regarded her reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so lightly about my profession!&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a magician. Now&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
explain the trick. You can look at the pack&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but we want to hear about the fire,&rdquo; interrupted
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a card!&rdquo; was his only reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>There was nothing to do but humor him. Jane
was delighted: she loved card tricks and listened
eagerly. But Mary Louise was more interested in
the burning of the bungalow.</p>
<p>At last, however, Clifford sat down beside
Jane on the couch-hammock and began to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw the ruins?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But nobody over at Flicks&rsquo; seemed to
know how it happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most amazing thing you ever heard of! It
was last Saturday night. I had four fellows from
the fraternity here for the week-end, and about
nine o&rsquo;clock we all piled into the boat and went
over to the Royal Hotel to dance. There happened
to be a bunch of girls staying there that
we knew, so we were sure of a swell time. The
whole gang from Shady Nook went across too&mdash;the
Reed family, the Partridges, the Robinsons&mdash;practically
everybody except the Flicks.
So you see Shady Nook was deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We danced till around twelve o&rsquo;clock and
had something to eat. Then the fellows suggested
we all get into the launch and go for a ride.
Mother was game: she went along too, and so
did a couple of the girls. By the time we took
them back to the hotel and came home, it must
have been two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you seen any flames?&rdquo; interrupted
Jane. &ldquo;From the river, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a flicker! But we had been motoring in
the other direction, and you know the hotel isn&rsquo;t
right across from our bungalow, so we shouldn&rsquo;t
have been likely to notice when we were dancing.
What wind there was blew the other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even when you reached your own dock,
didn&rsquo;t you smell smoke?&rdquo; demanded Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we did then. But the flames were all out.
The bungalow was gone&mdash;but the trees hadn&rsquo;t
caught fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was queer,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Gay. &ldquo;Unless
somebody put out the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody did, as far as we know,&rdquo; replied
Clifford. &ldquo;But it was out all right. And the bungalow
gone, all but the foundation stones!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world did you do?&rdquo; asked Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went over to the Partridges&rsquo;&mdash;they&rsquo;re the
people who live next to us on the other side,&rdquo; he
explained to Jane. &ldquo;Fortunately they were still
up, but they hadn&rsquo;t noticed the smoke for the
trees; they had been at the dance themselves till
about one o&rsquo;clock. Well, they gave Mother their
one extra bedroom, and we fellows slept in the
living room. That was O.K., but it was pretty
ghastly, losing everything at once. Especially
the clothes and things that belonged to our
guests. If it was going to happen, I don&rsquo;t see
why it couldn&rsquo;t have burned down when we
didn&rsquo;t have any company.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that must have been embarrassing,&rdquo;
agreed Mary Louise. She was thinking of David
McCall&rsquo;s accusation&mdash;that Clifford set the bungalow
on fire himself to get the insurance&mdash;and
it seemed absurd to her. He certainly would
have chosen a more convenient time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do the next day?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother and I went to our New York apartment,
and the fellows went home. I put in a
claim for the insurance, and after we had bought
new summer outfits, we came back here and took
a suite at the Royal. We expect to stay there all
summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not Flicks&rsquo;?&rdquo; was Mary Louise&rsquo;s next
question. &ldquo;Everybody goes there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just why we didn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re so overcrowded,
and Mother likes plenty of room. We
sure get that at the Royal. The hotel&rsquo;s practically
empty; I don&rsquo;t see how poor Frazier can
pay his taxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He charges too much,&rdquo; said Mary Louise.
&ldquo;If he&rsquo;d be content to make a small profit, the
way Mr. Flick does, he&rsquo;d probably fill his hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s an expensive place to keep up.
Mother feels sorry for him, so she&rsquo;s entertaining
a lot to bring him some business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel sorry for him! I don&rsquo;t like him.
Remember that time we wanted to give an entertainment
for the Red Cross and he tried to
charge us fifty dollars for using his dining room?
So we held it outdoors instead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clifford nodded. &ldquo;Yes. But he says he&rsquo;s poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So poor he can&rsquo;t pay his waitresses a living
wage! Hattie Adams&mdash;you remember, Jane, the
girl who waited on our table at Flicks&rsquo;?&mdash;said
he tried to pay her two dollars a week and excused
himself by telling her she&rsquo;d make a lot on
tips! She gets ten at Flicks&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man like that deserves to fail,&rdquo; agreed
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get back to the subject of the fire,&rdquo; said
Mary Louise, in her usual practical way whenever
there was a mystery to be solved, &ldquo;what is
your idea of the way it started, Cliff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it was just an accident,&rdquo; replied the
young man. &ldquo;Maybe it was some tramp or those
kids. You know the Smith boys and a few others.
Not the Reeds, for they were at the Royal. But
they&rsquo;re all full of mischief. Maybe they were
smoking corn silk in our garage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope not!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Gay, for
her son played a great deal with the Smith boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Freckles to snoop around a bit and keep
his eyes and ears open,&rdquo; suggested Clifford.
&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll learn something. He&rsquo;ll enjoy being
a detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled; the young man did not
know that she had proved herself a very good
detective earlier in the summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does your mother think?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>Clifford frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s suspicious. She believes there&rsquo;s
been dirty work. Actually thinks the place was
set on fire&mdash;on purpose! By Ditmar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditmar! Who is he? I never heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not. But you soon will. He&rsquo;s a
young architect who used to plan a lot of houses
for my father before he died. You know the two
new bungalows that were put up here this year&mdash;beyond
Flicks&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard there were two. But we haven&rsquo;t seen
them yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ditmar drew plans for them both. And
he and his young wife live in one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. But why would your mother suspect
Mr. Ditmar of setting fire to her cottage?&rdquo; asked
Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;So Ditmar
would get the job of designing a new one!
But that seems dreadful. Is this man the criminal
type, Cliff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can anybody tell who is the criminal
type nowadays, when every day we read in the
newspapers about senators and bankers stooping
to all sorts of despicable tricks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; agreed Jane. &ldquo;And is your mother going
to rebuild?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be Mother&mdash;it would be I who
would do it,&rdquo; explained Clifford. &ldquo;Because Dad
left the place to me, and all this land up here at
Shady Nook that hasn&rsquo;t been sold yet. But I
don&rsquo;t expect to do anything for a while. Mother&rsquo;s
comfortable at the Royal, and I don&rsquo;t mind.
Though I do like the people at Shady Nook a
lot better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you can come over as much as you
like,&rdquo; said Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is just what I intend to do! And that
reminds me, one of the things I came to talk to
you about: a swell shindig for Monday night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what?&rdquo; gasped Jane in delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A party down on the island. Everybody goes
in some kind of boat&mdash;naturally&mdash;all dressed
up. I mean, the boats are to be all dressed up,
you understand. With a prize for the best decorated
of each kind. Then we&rsquo;ll have a feed and
play games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; cried Jane enthusiastically.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we go in, Mary Lou? The canoe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought maybe you girls would come in
my motorboat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And lose the chance of winning a prize?&rdquo;
interrupted Mary Louise. &ldquo;Thanks just the same,
Cliff, but I&rsquo;ve got an idea already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David McCall was coming up the porch steps
just in time to hear the refusal, and he grinned
broadly. This was just as it should be, he
thought, looking possessively at Mary Louise.</p>
<p>Tall and dark and handsome, David McCall
was indeed a contrast to Clifford Hunter in appearance.
But Jane had already decided that she
did not like him. Nobody twenty-two years old
had any right to be so serious, even if he had
been supporting himself for five years!</p>
<p>Mary Louise was a trifle embarrassed as she
greeted him, wondering how he and Cliff would
get along together. But Cliff spoke to him cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Dave,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Sit down. I&rsquo;ve got a
brand-new trick. You take a card&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Jane giggled. How could anybody help liking
a boy like Cliff?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s waste our time on card tricks,&rdquo; was
David&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;The light&rsquo;s fading. We ought to
be out on the river. Or in it, if you prefer,&rdquo; he
added, addressing Mary Louise.</p>
<p>Clifford, disappointed, put his cards away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can show me all your tricks tomorrow,&rdquo;
whispered Jane sympathetically. &ldquo;I love them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a date!&rdquo; exclaimed Cliff eagerly.</p>
<p>Mary Louise stood up, to conceal her nervousness
at the sharp way in which David had
spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go somewhere.
Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my motorboat?&rdquo; suggested Cliff.</p>
<p>Everybody agreed, and the arrangement
proved satisfactory, for the boat was large
enough for Jane and Cliff to be together at the
wheel, and David and Mary Louise off in another
corner. Silky sat upright in the middle of
the boat, as if he believed he were the chaperon
and it was his sacred duty to keep his eye on
everybody.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>The evening passed pleasantly, for the stars
were out, and the breeze over the river delightfully
cool, and the boat itself in perfect condition.
Even David forgot his grudge against rich
young Hunter and under the magic spell of the
night joined happily in the singing. Mary
Louise, however, insisted that they come home
early, for though they hardly realized it, both
girls were tired from their long trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a glorious day!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane,
after the boys had gone home, and the girls were
preparing for bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy about Shady
Nook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s pretty nice myself,&rdquo; returned the
other, with a yawn. &ldquo;If only poor Cliff&rsquo;s bungalow
hadn&rsquo;t burned down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; urged Jane, &ldquo;which boy you really
like best&mdash;Cliff Hunter or David McCall or
Max Miller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Max, I guess. Now you answer
a question for me: Who do you think set the
Hunters&rsquo; bungalow on fire&mdash;Cliff himself, or
that Mr. Ditmar, the architect, or the kids?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you go!&rdquo; cried Jane. &ldquo;Being a detective
instead of a normal girl on her vacation.
Who cares, anyhow? It doesn&rsquo;t hurt anybody but
the insurance company, and I guess they can afford
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;d like terribly to know!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s waste our wonderful month
being detectives,&rdquo; pleaded Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it may be important,&rdquo; Mary Louise
pointed out. &ldquo;If it was done intentionally, there
will probably be more fires. Don&rsquo;t forget&mdash;our
cottage is next door to Hunters&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane opened her eyes wide in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to think of it,&rdquo; said Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Daddy is trusting me to look after things, and
I can&rsquo;t fall down on my job. Nothing like that
must happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you possibly do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investigate, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll begin by talking to Freckles tomorrow
and see whether he&rsquo;s found out anything from
the boys. Then I&rsquo;ll make it a point to meet Mr.
Ditmar&mdash;and follow up every clue I can get
hold of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would!&rdquo; yawned Jane as she crept sleepily
into her cot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><i>The Ditmars</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Freckles!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Louise as she entered
the kitchenette of the bungalow the following
morning. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy grinned mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell you that, Sis,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wanted to talk to you. And it&rsquo;s only a
little after eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but I&rsquo;m a busy guy. Important affairs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freckles hesitated; then he decided to tell part
of his secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellows up here have a secret band. It&rsquo;s
called the &lsquo;Wild Guys of the Road.&rsquo; I was initiated
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise burst out laughing. She couldn&rsquo;t
help it. &ldquo;The &lsquo;Wild Guys of the Road&rsquo;!&rdquo; she repeated.
&ldquo;Regular hold-up men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly,&rdquo; replied her brother. &ldquo;But
we&rsquo;ve got some exciting adventures on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the leader?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robby Smith. He&rsquo;s got some swell ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does burning people&rsquo;s houses come into his
plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, no! We&rsquo;re not really bad, Sis. We
wouldn&rsquo;t do anything like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you make fires at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we make fires. We&rsquo;ve got to cook our
camp meals, haven&rsquo;t we? And have our ceremonies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; She was thinking. &ldquo;And sometimes
those fires spread farther than you want them
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, course not! Now, don&rsquo;t you go blaming
us guys for Hunters&rsquo; bungalow burning down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not blaming <i>you</i>, Freckles&mdash;you weren&rsquo;t
even here. But I&rsquo;m not so sure about those Smith
boys. They are pretty wild, once they get started.
Remember the time they locked that little boy
in the boathouse and almost left him there all
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiz, Sis! They wouldn&rsquo;t have left him
there. They just wanted to scare him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure. They&rsquo;re spoiled kids. I wish
you wouldn&rsquo;t play with them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Sis, don&rsquo;t be silly! Everybody&rsquo;s in the
gang together. I&rsquo;ve got to play with the Smith
boys or else stay home by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a yell of good-bye for his mother, the
boy was off.</p>
<p>Mary Louise and Jane sat down to their
breakfast. Mrs. Gay, who had eaten hers with
Freckles, came in to talk to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you on the program for today?&rdquo;
she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the usual things,&rdquo; answered her daughter.
&ldquo;Tennis with the bunch this morning, and I
suppose everybody will go in swimming about
eleven o&rsquo;clock. David is coming over to talk
about fixing up our canoe for the contest tomorrow
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane coughed nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;uh&mdash;sort of promised Cliff I&rsquo;d go in his
motorboat, Mary Lou,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Would that
be all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; agreed her chum. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll
be even better, because the less weight we have
in our canoe, the more decoration we can put on.
And there&rsquo;s a prize for each type of boat, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shan&rsquo;t be competing against you if I
go in Cliff&rsquo;s launch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, we are in separate classes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>After the girls had finished washing the dishes
for Mrs. Gay, they started off for a little walk,
with Silky at their heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not stop for the Reed girls?&rdquo; suggested
Jane, mentioning the twins who lived in the cottage
on the far side of the Gays. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy to
meet them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll meet them when we go swimming
later on,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;But just now I
want to go in the other direction. To call on the
Ditmars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ditmars?&rdquo; For the moment Jane had
forgotten who these people were, for she had
heard so many new names the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Don&rsquo;t you remember? The young architect
that Cliff told us about. The man Mrs.
Hunter thinks set her bungalow on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, of course! In other words&mdash;a suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can we call on him if we don&rsquo;t know
him?&rdquo; asked Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find a way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure we will!&rdquo; teased Jane. &ldquo;Trust the
girl detective for that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sh! Please don&rsquo;t call me that in front of anybody,
Jane. If people think I am snooping,
they&rsquo;ll shut up like clams and won&rsquo;t tell me anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although there were only eight cottages at
Shady Nook, the distance from the Reeds&rsquo; on
one end to the Ditmars&rsquo; on the other was over a
mile. Cliff&rsquo;s father, Mr. Hunter, who had
planned the little resort, knew that even in a
small friendly community like this, people still
liked privacy, so he had left a small strip of
woods between every two cottages.</p>
<p>The girls walked along slowly, Mary Louise
pointing out the bungalows as they passed by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the Hunters&rsquo; was, of course,&rdquo;
she said to her chum. &ldquo;And now we&rsquo;re coming
to the Partridges&rsquo;. Next is Flicks&rsquo; Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember this much from last night,&rdquo;
nodded Jane. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s as far as we got. Are
there many cottages on the other side of
Flicks&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the Smiths&rsquo; and the two new ones. The
Smiths don&rsquo;t actually live on the river road, and
you can&rsquo;t call their place a cottage. It&rsquo;s really
the grandest house around here. Much bigger
than the Hunters&rsquo; was. They have three children
and a lot of servants. Mr. and Mrs. Smith are
usually off traveling somewhere, and even when
they&rsquo;re here, they don&rsquo;t eat at Flicks&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So we can&rsquo;t count on them for any fun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Freckles plays with the boys, but except
for that, we never see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little farther on, the girls came to the two
new bungalows, set right in the heart of the
woods. They were both perfectly charming; it
was evident that young Mr. Ditmar was an
architect with both taste and ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you love it?&rdquo; whispered Jane, as the
two girls approached the Ditmars&rsquo; rose-trellised
bungalow. &ldquo;It looks like &lsquo;Honeymoon Cottage&rsquo;
in a jig-saw puzzle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand the Ditmars are practically a
bride and groom,&rdquo; returned Mary Louise....
&ldquo;Oh, there she is, in the garden! Pretty, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An attractive young woman in a pink dress
looked up as the girls came nearer. She smiled
pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; said Mary Louise. &ldquo;You are
Mrs. Ditmar, aren&rsquo;t you? Everybody knows
everybody else here at Shady Nook, so we&rsquo;ll introduce
ourselves. This is my chum, Jane Patterson,
and I&rsquo;m Mary Louise Gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young woman nodded cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad to meet you both,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;This is a friendly place&mdash;I like it a lot.
If only my husband did&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Mr. Ditmar like Shady Nook?&rdquo;
asked Mary Louise in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he doesn&rsquo;t. But I guess it&rsquo;s just because
he hasn&rsquo;t enough to do. You know how men are
when they haven&rsquo;t any work: full of gloom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, things will be better this fall,&rdquo; remarked
Jane optimistically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Ditmar. &ldquo;At
least&mdash;for architects. Their work comes slowly.
It was fine all spring, while Horace had this
bungalow to build, and the Robinsons&rsquo; next
door. But now he can&rsquo;t get a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the Hunters will rebuild,&rdquo; suggested
Jane openly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ditmar shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did hope so. We went over to see them at
the Royal Hotel soon after their house burned
down, but Mrs. Hunter wasn&rsquo;t very nice to us.
She almost acted as if it were our fault!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane suppressed a giggle and muttered under
her breath, &ldquo;The plot thickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess she was just all upset,&rdquo; remarked
Mary Louise nervously. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll get over that.&rdquo;
She smiled. &ldquo;Anyway, you don&rsquo;t have to be
gloomy, Mrs. Ditmar. Can&rsquo;t you get your tennis
things on and play with us this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks awfully, but I don&rsquo;t think I had better
leave Horace here alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t come. No, I better not. But
perhaps I&rsquo;ll see you in swimming later on in the
morning. It&rsquo;s awfully nice of you girls to be so
friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look for you in the water, then....
And, by the way, you&rsquo;ll come to the party on the
island tomorrow night, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the young woman refused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we really can&rsquo;t afford that. It&rsquo;s two dollars
for the supper, you know, and besides that;
we&rsquo;d have to hire one of Mr. Frazier&rsquo;s canoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you borrow one?&rdquo; suggested Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;Horace refused to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise sighed, as if to say how thankful
she was that she wasn&rsquo;t married to a grouch like
that. So the girls said good-bye and walked
slowly back to their cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be over twenty, if she&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; surmised
Mary Louise. &ldquo;I certainly feel sorry for
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; agreed Jane. &ldquo;Do you really think
her husband is guilty, Mary Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He sounds queer.&rdquo; She lowered
her voice: there did not appear to be anybody
around, but you never could tell, with all
those thick trees to conceal possible eavesdroppers.
&ldquo;And if he believes it&rsquo;s his right to
have work, he may try burning other cottages.
That&rsquo;s what worries me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he surely wouldn&rsquo;t pick on yours,
Mary Lou,&rdquo; was Jane&rsquo;s comforting assurance.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d select somebody&rsquo;s who was rich&mdash;like the
Smiths&rsquo;, or some place that was absolutely necessary,
like the Flicks&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were passing the inn at this moment,
and as they looked up they saw David McCall
in his tennis clothes coming out of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was over at the bungalow looking for you
girls,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Reed girls are on the court,
but they wouldn&rsquo;t let me play until I found a
partner. So please hurry up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise. &ldquo;Walk back
with us, Dave. I want you to tell me why you
think Cliff Hunter set his own bungalow on fire&mdash;at
such an inconvenient time. When they had
company, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David smiled knowingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his alibi, of course. What did he care
about those four fellows? It didn&rsquo;t hurt them.
You see, Mary Lou, I&rsquo;m an insurance agent, and
I&rsquo;m up to all these tricks. The Hunters&rsquo; place
was insured for ten thousand dollars, and if it
had been offered for sale, Cliff couldn&rsquo;t have
gotten more than a couple thousand at a time
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Hunters are rich,&rdquo; objected Mary
Louise. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t need the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody needs money. And I happen to
know that Cliff wants to go around the world
this fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t give up college?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. There&rsquo;s a college course in the bargain.
They study and travel at the same time. It costs
a small fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he set that bungalow on fire,&rdquo;
announced Jane. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too honest. He just
couldn&rsquo;t do a thing like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added Mary Louise, &ldquo;we have another
suspect.&rdquo; And she told David what she had
just learned about Horace Ditmar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as sure that Ditmar didn&rsquo;t do it as
you are that Cliff Hunter didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied David
when she had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably nobody set it on fire,&rdquo; concluded
Jane. &ldquo;Just an accident. Let&rsquo;s forget it. Come on
in, Mary Lou, and we&rsquo;ll put on our sneaks.
We&rsquo;ll be ready in a minute, Dave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>True to their promise, the girls returned a moment
later, with Silky at their heels, and all
three young people made their way to the tennis
court. There was only one court at Shady
Nook&mdash;which the boys themselves had made&mdash;but
there was another across the river on the
hotel grounds. However, nobody ever seemed
to mind waiting or taking turns, so the crowd
usually stayed together.</p>
<p>Jane was introduced to the Reed twins, who
looked and dressed so exactly alike that she had
not the faintest idea which was Mabel and
which was Sue after a couple of minutes had
elapsed. Then there were three other young
people who were staying at the inn for a short
time, besides David McCall and themselves. To
her dismay, Cliff Hunter did not come across the
river to join the party.</p>
<p>The whole crowd went in swimming about
eleven o&rsquo;clock, and here their elders joined
them, with some of the younger children. Not
Freckles, however, or the Reed boys or the
Smiths: they had gone off hiking for the day.
Again Jane did not see Cliff Hunter, and she
was giving all her attention to a young man
named Stuart Robinson, who lived in the new
bungalow next to the Ditmars&rsquo;, when she heard
her name shouted from the shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jane! Oh, Jane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raising her head from her swimming position
and treading water, she peered towards the
shore. It was Cliff Hunter&mdash;but not attired in a
bathing suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on out!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>Jane swung into the crawl, and reached the
young man in a couple of minutes. He was grinning
broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a card,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Jane burst out laughing. &ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m soaked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ve got plenty of packs.
This is a swell trick. I&rsquo;ve been studying it all
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane dropped down on the grass and listened
to his trick. The young man was enchanted. She
stayed with him until Mary Louise literally
dragged her back into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How anybody could believe Cliff Hunter
guilty of a despicable crime,&rdquo; she said later to
her chum, &ldquo;is beyond me. He&rsquo;s as innocent as a
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; returned Mary Louise. &ldquo;Time
will tell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><i>Another Fire</i></h2>
<p>Everybody at Shady Nook worked all day
Monday on the decorations for the boats. Everybody,
that is, except Mr. and Mrs. Flick and a
few of the older people, who were preparing
the food for the supper on the little island that
night. Jane was helping Clifford Hunter paint
pieces of wood which were intended to transform
his launch into an auto-giro, and David
McCall and Mary Louise picked flowers and
leaves all afternoon to make festoons for her
canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think Freckles and those other kids
might have helped us,&rdquo; she remarked as she tied
on the last cluster of sunflowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we didn&rsquo;t need them,&rdquo; returned David,
smiling. He had enjoyed having Mary Louise to
himself all afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s five o&rsquo;clock now. We&rsquo;ll have to hurry and
wash and dress. Don&rsquo;t forget supper at Flicks&rsquo;
is half-past tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>The young man nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be ready, Mary
Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay&rsquo;s voice interrupted them from the
inside of the bungalow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has anybody seen Freckles?&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since this morning,&rdquo; replied her daughter.
&ldquo;I tried to get him to help us, but he said he
was off for the day with his gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that. I gave him some lunch.
But he ought to be home by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll probably be along in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he did not come. David went back to the
inn, and Mrs. Gay and the two girls dressed for
the picnic, but still Freckles did not appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go off and leave him without any
supper,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gay. &ldquo;Because Mrs. Flick is
going to close the dining room and lock up at
six-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could only phone the Smiths,&rdquo; sighed
Mary Louise. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably over there with
the boys.... Suppose Jane and I run over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too far. It will make you late for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very late. We&rsquo;ll hurry. Come on, Jane.
We&rsquo;ll be back in ten minutes. But you go on
down to the inn, Mother, and order the dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>Mrs. Gay nodded, immensely relieved. What
a comfort Mary Louise was! You never had to
ask her to do anything for you.</p>
<p>The two girls hurried away along the private
road beside the river, past the Flicks&rsquo; and the
Robinsons&rsquo;, then turned up the hill to the
Smiths&rsquo; house beyond. It was Jane&rsquo;s first sight
of the imposing-looking place at close range.
She exclaimed in admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a marvelous house! They must be awfully
rich!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;But they
don&rsquo;t appreciate this place a bit. Mr. and Mrs.
Smith are hardly ever here at all in the summer.
Those two boys just run wild. There&rsquo;s a nurse
to look after the little girl&mdash;she&rsquo;s only four years
old&mdash;but the boys do pretty much as they please
and boss the servants around. That&rsquo;s why
Mother and I feel worried about Freckles when
he&rsquo;s with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sedate-looking butler answered the girls&rsquo;
ring at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, miss,&rdquo; was his reply to Mary Louise&rsquo;s
question, &ldquo;the boys haven&rsquo;t been here all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they expect to go to the picnic tonight
on the island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, miss. Steve, the chauffeur, was to take
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Mary Louise sighed. There was nothing she
could do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if my brother comes back here, will
you please send him right over to the inn?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;And tell him to hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls turned away and started back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
going to spoil Mother&rsquo;s evening,&rdquo; remarked
Mary Louise disconsolately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll be sure to turn up soon,&rdquo; returned
Jane reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but even if he does, he won&rsquo;t be able
to get to the island. All the boats at Shady Nook
are being used. Even the rowboats. Everybody&rsquo;s
going except the Ditmars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Adelaide Ditmar!&rdquo; sighed Jane. &ldquo;Imagine
missing all that fun just because of a
grouchy husband! I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m single.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All men aren&rsquo;t alike, Jane. You know Cliff
Hunter would never miss any fun. Or Max or
Norman,&rdquo; she added, mentioning their two best
friends in Riverside.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay looked up hopefully as the girls
entered the inn, but her expression changed immediately.
She could tell from their faces that
they had not been successful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>After supper was over, all was bustle and excitement
as the people got into the boats and
pushed them out into the river. There were six
canoes, four rowboats, and three motorboats, all
decorated beautifully or fantastically, according
to the taste of the owners. Three prizes were
to be awarded for the cleverest boat of each type,
and everybody was to vote on the style in which
he or she was not competing. Mary Louise and
David McCall stepped into their flower-covered
canoe; Mrs. Gay joined the Partridges in a rowboat,
and Jane waited for Cliff Hunter&rsquo;s motorboat
to come puffing across the river. It arrived
at the same time as the Fraziers&rsquo; rather seedy
launch, and Jane was introduced to them and to
Mrs. Hunter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll walk away with the motorboat prize,
Cliff,&rdquo; called Mary Louise to the young man at
the wheel. She lowered her voice. &ldquo;Poor old
Frazier&rsquo;s launch is pathetic, and Stuart Robinson&rsquo;s
is just funny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the prize is a deck of cards,&rdquo; returned
Cliff. &ldquo;Mine are wearing out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise laughed and dipped her paddle
into the water. Her canoe did look pretty, and it
was a heavenly night. If only Freckles were
there!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>The boats began to move off, the launches
puffing ahead, the canoes gliding gently behind
them, and the rowboats progressing more ponderously.
Somebody began to play a ukulele, and
gay voices took up the tune.</p>
<p>The island, a small oblong strip of land, was
situated about two miles down the river from
Shady Nook. Several years ago someone at the
resort had discovered it, and everybody had
taken a hand at fixing it up for picnic purposes.
There was a glorious stone fireplace, and a large
spot had been cleared for dancing and games.
Seats had been scattered about, and a couple of
board tables had been erected near the fireplace.
Tonight the whole island was alight with Japanese
lanterns, giving it a gay and festive air.</p>
<p>When the last rowboat had finally reached its
destination, the crowd all gathered together on
the grass near the shore to record their votes.
The two Robinson boys went about collecting
them.</p>
<p>Mary Louise was sitting close to her mother,
watching her intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Reed boys aren&rsquo;t here either,&rdquo; whispered
Mrs. Gay. &ldquo;I was just talking to Mrs.
Reed, and she said she hasn&rsquo;t seen Larry or
George since morning. But she doesn&rsquo;t seem
much worried.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Freckles must be all right if he&rsquo;s with the
whole bunch,&rdquo; Mary Louise assured her. &ldquo;Nothing
much could happen to five boys together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay forced herself to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try not to worry, dear.... Oh, listen!
Mr. Robinson is going to announce the
winners!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jovial-faced man, Stuart&rsquo;s father, stepped
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First prize for rowboats goes to Sue and
Mabel Reed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come forward, girls,
and get your prize. It&rsquo;s a box of tennis balls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The twins, dressed exactly alike in blue
dimity, came up together, bowing and expressing
their thanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prize for canoes&mdash;to Mary Louise
Gay,&rdquo; continued Mr. Robinson. &ldquo;More tennis
balls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>David McCall clapped loudly, and everybody
else joined in the applause. Mary Louise
was a general favorite at Shady Nook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prize for motorboats goes to my son
Stuart for his funny-looking contraption!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Everybody clapped but Jane; she was terribly
disappointed. She didn&rsquo;t see why Cliff&rsquo;s clever
idea hadn&rsquo;t taken the honors. But glancing at
the young man she could detect no resentment in
his face. He was a wonderful sport.</p>
<p>After the prizes had been disposed of, the
games began, and continued until dark. Almost
everyone joined in the fun&mdash;even the middle-aged
people. All except a few who were helping
Mrs. Flick prepare the refreshments, and
Mrs. Hunter and the Fraziers, who were too
stiff and dignified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like Mrs. Hunter?&rdquo; whispered
Mary Louise once when the two chums found
themselves hiding side by side in a game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind of stuck up,&rdquo; replied Jane. &ldquo;But she&rsquo;s
better than those Fraziers. He&rsquo;s positively oily!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you? I wouldn&rsquo;t stay in his hotel
if our bungalow burned down&mdash;no matter how
much money we had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hunter seems to like him. But I think
it&rsquo;s Frazier who put the idea into her head that
Ditmar set her cottage on fire. Because I heard
him say to her, &lsquo;I wonder whose place will burn
down tonight. Ditmar stayed home!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh! Oh, gosh, we&rsquo;re caught! Why must girls
always talk?&rdquo; lamented Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>The moon came up in the sky, making the
night more enchanting, more wonderful than
before. The games broke up, and Mrs. Flick
called the people to refreshments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit with me, Mary Lou,&rdquo; urged David,
jealously touching her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must find Mother,&rdquo; returned the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s over there with Mrs. Hunter and the
hotel bunch. You don&rsquo;t want to be with them,
do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not particularly. But I do want to be with
Mother and Jane and Cliff. So come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>David closed his lips tightly, but he followed
Mary Louise just the same. Mrs. Gay made a
place for them, and the young couple sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not still worried, are you, Mother?&rdquo;
asked Mary Louise as she passed the chicken
salad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I am, dear. If we could only see
Shady Nook from here, perhaps the boys would
flash their lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re surely all right,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Hunter
consolingly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re big enough to take care of
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say they are,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Frazier. &ldquo;I
caught them cutting my yew tree to make bows.
There&rsquo;s nothing they can&rsquo;t do!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Mary Louise regarded the hotelkeeper with
contempt, thinking again how stingy he was.
Anybody else would be glad to give the boys
a branch of a tree!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as they don&rsquo;t set anything on fire,&rdquo;
observed Cliff lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cliff!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Louise in horror.</p>
<p>David McCall nudged her meaningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Criminals always try to cover up their crimes
by laying the suspicion on somebody else,&rdquo; he
whispered. &ldquo;But only a cad would blame innocent
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise cast him a withering look. She
was beginning to despise David McCall.</p>
<p>When the whole party had eaten all they possibly
could, somebody started to play a ukulele,
and the young people danced on the smooth
grass that had been worn down by so many picnics.
Nobody apparently wanted to go home,
except Mrs. Gay. Finally Mrs. Reed, beginning
to be anxious about her own two boys, seconded
the motion for departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give the rowboats twenty minutes
start,&rdquo; suggested Cliff Hunter. &ldquo;And the canoes
ten. We&rsquo;ll beat you all at that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If our engines don&rsquo;t give out,&rdquo; put in Stuart
Robinson doubtfully. He never felt confident
about his ancient motorboat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me fine!&rdquo; cried Jane, realizing that the
arrangement gave her twenty extra minutes to
dance.</p>
<p>The rowboats pushed off, and ten minutes
later Mary Louise and her mother and David
stepped into their canoe. It was a light craft,
built for speed, and both she and David were
excellent paddlers. In no time at all they were
leading the procession.</p>
<p>It was David&rsquo;s sharp eyes which first detected
signs of a disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fire at Shady Nook!&rdquo; he cried
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Gay in horror, and turning
about swiftly, Mary Louise thought that her
mother was going to faint. But she didn&rsquo;t; she
pulled herself together quickly and sat up very
straight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise, her voice
trembling with fear. Suppose it were their own
cottage&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;Freckles!</p>
<p><a href="#front" id="rfront">The canoe rounded the bend in the river and came within full view of the little resort.</a>
The Reeds&rsquo; house was visible now&mdash;yes&mdash;and the
Gays&rsquo;! Thank heaven it was unharmed!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s either the Partridges&rsquo; or Flicks&rsquo;,&rdquo; announced
David. &ldquo;And my bet is that it&rsquo;s Flicks&rsquo;.
I was expecting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were expecting it, David?&rdquo; repeated
Mrs. Gay in consternation. &ldquo;What do you mean
by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Cliff Hunter holds a big mortgage
on Flicks&rsquo; Inn,&rdquo; replied the young man. &ldquo;It
means ready cash for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be absurd!&rdquo; commanded Mary Louise.
&ldquo;How could Cliff have anything to do with it
when he was with us all evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you ever heard of a bribe, Mary
Lou?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The girl did not answer. The increasing noise
of the engines behind them told them that the
motorboats had caught up with them. Everybody
knew about the disaster now; Mrs. Flick
was crying, and Mr. Flick was yelling and waving
his arms wildly, calling upon everybody to
help him.</p>
<p>He was out of his boat first&mdash;he happened to
be riding in the Robinsons&rsquo; launch&mdash;and he
dashed madly through the trees that stood between
his inn and the river. In his excitement, he
almost knocked over a small boy carrying a pail
of water from the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Freckles!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Gay, in a tone of both
relief and fear: relief that her child was safe,
fear that he had had something to do with the
fire. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to save the trees,&rdquo; explained the boy.
&ldquo;The inn was gone when we got here, but us
guys kept the fire from spreading.&rdquo; He looked
up proudly, as if he expected a medal for his
bravery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it!&rdquo; thundered Mr.
Flick. &ldquo;I believe you boys set the place on fire.
And now you&rsquo;re trying to lie out of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put it past &rsquo;em,&rdquo; muttered Mr.
Frazier, at his side. The Fraziers had landed
at Shady Nook instead of crossing to the hotel&rsquo;s
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the truth, boys!&rdquo; urged Mrs. Gay, for
by this time both the Smiths and the two young
Reeds had joined Freckles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came along here about dark,&rdquo; said Larry
Reed, who was the oldest of the group, &ldquo;and
smelled smoke. Course, we investigated. The inn
was gone. But the ashes were still smoldering,
and there was smoke coming out from the
bushes. So we ran over to Gays&rsquo; and to our house
and got buckets and carried water from the
river. It&rsquo;s about out now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure that&rsquo;s the truth?&rdquo; demanded Mr.
Reed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my honor, Dad!&rdquo; replied the boy
solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see anybody in the woods or around
Shady Nook?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Flick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. A big guy who looked like a tramp
from the woods&mdash;it was too dark to see his face&mdash;and
a funny-looking woman in a gray dress
with a big pitcher under her arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Together?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The big guy was in the woods. And the
woman was running along the road that leads to
Four Corners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but a made-up yarn!&rdquo; denounced
Mr. Flick.</p>
<p>But the fire was really out; there was nothing
anybody could do. Frazier suggested that the
Flicks and their guests come over to his hotel,
and the latter accepted. But the Flicks, realizing
that this was not a real invitation, that the hotelkeeper
would present them with a bill later on,
chose to stay with the Partridges. So at last the
group dispersed for the night.</p>
<p>Mary Louise, however, was so exasperated
with David McCall that she never even answered
his pleasant &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><i>Freckles&rsquo; Story</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world are you doing?&rdquo; asked
Jane when she came out on the porch the following
morning to find her chum studiously poring
over a notebook. &ldquo;You must think school has
begun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s harder than school&mdash;but it&rsquo;s more fun,&rdquo;
she replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on the mystery of the
fires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery? You really don&rsquo;t think the Flicks&rsquo;
Inn was just an accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. If it were the first fire, I might
believe that. But with the Hunters&rsquo; a week or so
ago, the whole thing looks sinister to me. I&rsquo;m
frightened, Jane. Ours may be the next. We
haven&rsquo;t any insurance to speak of. Besides, something
dreadful might happen to Mother. People
are burned to death sometimes, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; replied Jane seriously. &ldquo;But
what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Treat it just like a case, as I did Dark
Cedars. List all the possible suspects and search
the neighborhood for desperate characters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as gypsies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not gypsies. They wouldn&rsquo;t have any
motive this time. But somebody must have a motive&mdash;unless
it&rsquo;s a crazy person who is responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea, Mary Lou! There are people
like that&mdash;crazy along just one particular line.
They feel they simply have to light fires. Firebugs,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incendiary is the correct term, I believe,&rdquo;
said Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;ve already thought of it and
looked up the word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve thought of it. Who wouldn&rsquo;t have?
It&rsquo;s the first explanation that jumps into your
head when you hear of a fire. They say lighted
cigarettes start them too, and small children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small children? But not boys as big as
Freckles and the Smiths?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An expression of pain passed over Mary
Louise&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid everybody suspects the boys.
Especially Mr. Flick.... I&rsquo;m going to call
Freckles now and ask him just exactly what he
did yesterday. Then, if you&rsquo;re interested, Jane,
I&rsquo;ll read you all my list of suspects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;m interested. I love to play the part
of Watson to the great Sherlock Holmes Gay!&rdquo;
Mary Louise stuck out her tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so fresh!&rdquo; she said, but she was
pleased and flattered to be called Sherlock
Holmes.</p>
<p>Freckles, eating a bun and followed by Silky,
came leisurely through the screen door. Mary
Louise asked him to sit down and talk to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t long,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Have to go see
old man Flick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of Mr. Flick in that disrespectful
way!&rdquo; said Mary Louise disapprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, though. I hate him. He thinks us guys
set his old inn on fire, and we really saved his
trees. Sweatin&rsquo; like horses, carryin&rsquo; water from
the river, and that&rsquo;s all the thanks we get!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freckles,&rdquo; said his sister seriously, &ldquo;you must
tell me all about what you did yesterday. Everything!
No secrets. Because this is important. It
may save somebody innocent from imprisonment&mdash;and
help spot the real criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., I will, Sis.&rdquo; He sat down on the hammock,
and Silky jumped up beside him. He gave
the little dog a piece of his bun, and then he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up in the woods beyond Shady Nook&mdash;past
the Ditmars&rsquo;, you know, and all the cottages&mdash;we&rsquo;re
building a shack. A clubhouse for the
&lsquo;Wild Guys of the Road.&rsquo; So yesterday we took
our lunch&mdash;the two Smiths, the two Reeds, and
I&mdash;to set to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you make a fire?&rdquo; demanded Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we made a fire. We got to have a fire.
But don&rsquo;t you go thinking that fire spread to
Flicks&rsquo;. If it had, why wouldn&rsquo;t Ditmars&rsquo; and
Robinsons&rsquo; cottages have been burned? They&rsquo;re
in between.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true. Did you stay there in the
woods all day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Cooked some hot dogs for our supper,
and Larry Reed had a can of baked beans. Boy,
we had a swell feed! And never thought a thing
about the picnic on the island till it started to
get dark. Then we put out the fire, packed our
stuff away, and made tracks for home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About what time was that?&rdquo; asked Mary
Louise. &ldquo;I mean, when you finally left your
camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine-thirty or ten, maybe. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you saw two people on your way back,
you said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four people, really, because the Ditmars
were taking a walk in the woods. They were
quarreling, I&rsquo;m sure. She was mad at him. Said
she thought he was positively cruel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane. &ldquo;Looks as if Horace
Ditmar might have set the place on fire himself&mdash;just
as Mr. Frazier was expecting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise wrote something in her notebook,
and Freckles continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, a little farther on, we met a tramp. At
least, we think he was a tramp, though it was too
dark to see his face. He was a big man in shabby
old clothes. Overalls, I think. He was coming
towards us&mdash;away from Shady Nook. We think
he&rsquo;s the man you want!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you ever seen him before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be
sure. After we passed him, we saw the funny-looking
woman with the big pitcher under her
arm. The moon was out then, and we got a good
look at her. We all think she was crazy&mdash;kind
of talking to herself as she went along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, as we came nearer to Shady Nook, we
smelled smoke and found out it was Flicks&rsquo;. The
inn was burned down by then&mdash;it was all wood,
you know&mdash;but there was plenty of fire smoldering
around. So we got some buckets at our own
houses and began carrying water from the river.
We must have worked a couple of hours....
Till you came along.... That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to tell this story to Mr. Flick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a story!&rdquo; cried the boy indignantly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way,&rdquo; Mary Louise
hastened to assure him. &ldquo;I believe you, Freckles.
But I do wish you had someone to swear to the
truth of it&mdash;for the people who may not believe
you. Some witness, I mean. Did the Ditmars see
you boys in the woods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. When we heard their voices&mdash;and I told
you she was good and mad&mdash;we beat it around
another path. Women murder their husbands
sometimes, you know!&rdquo; he added solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Mrs. Ditmar would commit
murder,&rdquo; replied his sister. &ldquo;We met her yesterday
morning, and she seemed awfully nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freckles stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I better be on my way. Old man
Flick&rsquo;s got an awful temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, be sure to keep yours,&rdquo; Mary Louise
warned him as he walked down the steps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>She turned to Jane. &ldquo;What do you think about
it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a mess. But I don&rsquo;t believe anybody&rsquo;s
guilty. Probably just some careless servant
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m going over to see Mr.
Flick this morning. I&rsquo;ll have a good reason now
that Freckles is sort of involved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll read you my list of suspects and
their motives, and you tell me what you think
and whether you can add any names:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Horace Ditmar&mdash;motive, to make work for
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Flick and Cliff Hunter&mdash;owners, to
collect insurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tramp and queer-looking woman&mdash;firebugs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Careless servants&mdash;and</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The boys.&rsquo;... Now, can you think of anybody
else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like Mr. Ditmar to me&mdash;or else the
careless servants,&rdquo; replied Jane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never believe
it was Cliff Hunter. Or Mr. Flick. Why,
Mr. Flick was making money this summer&mdash;he&rsquo;d
be a fool to set his place on fire. Besides, he
was at the picnic. How could he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Things like that can be arranged,&rdquo; replied
Mary Louise, thinking of David McCall&rsquo;s accusation.
&ldquo;That tramp, for instance, might have
been bribed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure he wouldn&rsquo;t want to. Now,
if it were that man Frazier&rsquo;s place, the Royal
Hotel, I mean, it would be possible. You know
what Cliff said about the way he&rsquo;s losing money.
The hotel is practically empty, except for the
Hunters and their friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it will give Mr. Frazier an idea,&rdquo; remarked
Mary Louise, &ldquo;and his hotel be the next
to burn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to feel sure that something is coming
next!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so. And I only hope it won&rsquo;t be
our bungalow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise sighed and closed her notebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much more difficult than that mystery at
Dark Cedars,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Because there you had
only one place to watch. If I knew which cottage
would be the next to burn, I could hide
there and spy. But Shady Nook&rsquo;s a mile long,
and I can&rsquo;t be everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Jane. &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t like to
stay home from all the parties just on a chance
that there will be a fire. Has it occurred to you,
Mary Lou, that both fires started when everybody
from Shady Nook was off on a party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it has. That&rsquo;s why it seems like a planned
crime to me&mdash;not just an accident. As if the
criminal picked his time carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The familiar &ldquo;chug-chug&rdquo; of a motorboat interrupted
the girls&rsquo; discussion. Clifford Hunter
shut off his engine and threw the rope around the
Gays&rsquo; dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, girls!&rdquo; he called, with his usual grin.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had time to work up any new card
tricks, but I hope I&rsquo;ll be welcome just the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we have more serious things to think
about than tricks,&rdquo; responded Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that now you have to turn in and
do the cooking since Flicks&rsquo; Inn is gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really hadn&rsquo;t thought of that,&rdquo; answered
Mary Louise. &ldquo;Though of course we shall have
to do that very thing. We aren&rsquo;t rich enough to
eat at the Royal Hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so steep, considering the service you
get. Maybe Frazier will lower his prices, for he
sure needs the business. But, of course, you have
a large family. It would be kind of expensive.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where can we buy food?&rdquo; inquired Jane. So
far, the Gays&rsquo; breakfasts had consisted of supplies
they brought along with them, with the
addition of milk, butter, and eggs from a farmer
who stopped daily at Flicks&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a store over at Four Corners,&rdquo; replied
her chum, naming the nearest village&mdash;about
five miles away. &ldquo;We usually drive over
once a week for supplies. I suppose I better go
in now and ask Mother how soon she wants me
to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be my guests tonight at the Royal for dinner,&rdquo;
suggested Cliff. &ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t have to
bother about buying stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Cliff, but there are too many of us.
Besides, I&rsquo;d have to go to the store anyway.
We&rsquo;ll need things for lunch. You know how
hungry we are when we come out from swimming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; asked Jane, &ldquo;where is David
McCall staying? And the other people who were
boarding at Flicks&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all over at the hotel,&rdquo; answered
Cliff. &ldquo;Makes the place seem quite lively.
Frazier&rsquo;s stepping around at a great rate, looking
pleased as Punch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Louise significantly,
and she wrote another name into her notebook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>She ran inside the cottage and five minutes
later returned with her mother&rsquo;s list of groceries
and the keys to the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going over to Four Corners now, Jane,&rdquo;
she announced. &ldquo;Will you come with me or play
around with Cliff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her chum stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse
me, Cliff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man made a face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane only likes me for my card tricks,&rdquo; he
whined. &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t amuse her, I&rsquo;m no use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work up a new one while we&rsquo;re gone,&rdquo; advised
Jane. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll see you in swimming.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><i>More Suspects</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I told Mother we girls would take every other
day at the housekeeping,&rdquo; said Mary Louise as
she backed the car out of the garage and onto
the road behind the cottages. &ldquo;That will give her
a chance to get some rest from cooking&mdash;some
vacation. You don&rsquo;t mind, do you, Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course I don&rsquo;t mind!&rdquo; replied her chum.
&ldquo;Maybe the family will, though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it! We&rsquo;re swell cooks, if I
do say it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drove the car along past the backs of the
cottages, turning at the road beyond Ditmars in
the direction of the little village of Four Corners&mdash;a
place not much bigger than its name implied.
It was a still, hot day; all the vegetation
looked parched and dried, and the road was
thick with dust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish it would rain,&rdquo; remarked Mary
Louise. &ldquo;If we should have another fire, it might
spread so that it would wipe out all of Shady
Nook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s forget fires for a while,&rdquo; urged
Jane. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting positively morbid on the
subject!... Is this the grocery?&rdquo; she asked as
her companion stopped in front of a big wooden
house. &ldquo;It looks more like a dry-goods store to
me. All those aprons and overalls hanging
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a country store,&rdquo; explained the other
girl. &ldquo;Wait till you see the inside! They have
everything&mdash;even shoes. And the storekeeper
looks over his glasses just the way they always do
in plays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls jumped out of the car and ran inside.
Jane found the place just as Mary Louise
had described it: a typical country store of the
old-fashioned variety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mr. Eberhardt! How are you this
summer?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, Miss Gay&mdash;fine. You&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; well,
too. But I hear you had some excitement over to
Shady Nook. A bad fire, they tell me. Can you
figure out how it happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;You see,
everybody was away at the time&mdash;at a picnic on
the little island down the river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like spite to me,&rdquo; observed the storekeeper.
&ldquo;Bet Lemuel Adams or his good-fer-nuthin&rsquo;
son done it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lemuel Adams?&rdquo; repeated Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Who is he? Any relation to Hattie Adams, who
always waited on the table at Flicks&rsquo; Inn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep&mdash;he&rsquo;s her father. You ought to know
him. He&rsquo;s a farmer who lives up that hill, &rsquo;bout
a couple of miles from Shady Nook. Well, he
used to own all this ground around here, but he
sold it cheap to a man named Hunter. The one
who started the settlement at Shady Nook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I knew him,&rdquo; said Mary Louise. &ldquo;He
was Clifford Hunter&rsquo;s father. But he died not
long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I heard. Anyhow, this man Hunter got
fancy prices for his building lots, and naterally
old Lem Adams got sore. Always complainin&rsquo;
how poor he is and how rich old Hunter got
on his land. Reckon it got under his skin, and
mebbe he decided to take revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise wanted to write the name of
Lemuel Adams into her notebook then and there,
but she didn&rsquo;t like to. Should she add Hattie&rsquo;s
name too? Had the girl taken any part in the
plot?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of looking man is Mr. Adams?&rdquo;
she inquired, thinking of the &ldquo;tramp&rdquo; whom the
boys had mentioned seeing in the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old man&mdash;with white hair. Has a bad leg&mdash;rheumatism,
I reckon. He walks with a limp,&rdquo;
explained the storekeeper.</p>
<p>Mary Louise sighed: this couldn&rsquo;t be the same
person, then, for the boys would surely have noticed
a limp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my list,&rdquo; she said, handing her
mother&rsquo;s paper to Mr. Eberhardt. &ldquo;Do you
think you have all those things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ain&rsquo;t, I can get &rsquo;em fer you,&rdquo; was the
cheerful reply.</p>
<p>The girls wandered idly about the store while
they waited for their order to be filled. Jane had
a wonderful time examining the queer articles
on display and laughing at the ready-made
dresses. At last, however, a boy carried their supplies
to the car, and Mary Louise asked for the
bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nine dollars and sixty-two cents,&rdquo; announced
Mr. Eberhardt, with a grin. &ldquo;You folks sure
must like to eat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise. &ldquo;I suppose
this will mean more business for you. Or did the
Flicks buy groceries from you anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, they didn&rsquo;t. They got most of their stuff
from the city.... Yes, in a way it&rsquo;s a streak of
luck fer me. The old sayin&rsquo;, you know&mdash;that it&rsquo;s
an ill wind that brings nobody luck!... Yes,
I&rsquo;ll have to be stockin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise and Jane followed the boy to the
car and drove away. As soon as they were safely
out of hearing, Mary Louise said significantly,
&ldquo;Two more suspects for my notebook!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two?&rdquo; repeated Jane. &ldquo;You mean Lemuel
Adams and his son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of the son,&rdquo; replied Mary
Louise, &ldquo;Though, of course, he&rsquo;s a possibility.
No, I was thinking of Mr. Eberhardt, the storekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The storekeeper! Now, Mary Lou, your
ideas are running wild. Next thing you&rsquo;ll be
suspecting me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I do,&rdquo; laughed her chum. &ldquo;No, but
seriously&mdash;if Dad is working on a murder case,
he always finds out immediately who profited
by the victim&rsquo;s death. That supplies a motive for
the crime. Well, it&rsquo;s the same with a fire. Didn&rsquo;t
this storekeeper profit&mdash;by getting extra business&mdash;because
Flicks&rsquo; burned down?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did,&rdquo; admitted the other girl. &ldquo;But,
on the other hand, it didn&rsquo;t do him a bit of good
for the Hunters&rsquo; bungalow to be destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. But, then, that may have
been an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet this Lemuel Adams might have been
responsible for both fires. He seems a lot
guiltier to me. If he hated Mr. Hunter particularly,
he&rsquo;d naturally burn his cottage first.
Then he&rsquo;d go about destroying all the rest of
Shady Nook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your reasoning sounds good to me, Jane,&rdquo;
approved Mary Louise, her brown eyes sparkling
with excitement. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve got to make
a call on Mr. Adams right away. This very afternoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going canoeing
with Cliff Hunter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise looked disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose Watson had told Sherlock Holmes
that he had a date with a girl and couldn&rsquo;t go
on an investigation with him when he was
needed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watson was only a man in a book who didn&rsquo;t
make dates. I&rsquo;m a real girl who&rsquo;s full of life. I
came up here for some fun, not just to be an old
character in a detective story! And besides, Mary
Lou, you have a date too. I heard you promise
David McCall you&rsquo;d go canoeing with him today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mad at David,&rdquo; objected Mary Louise.
&ldquo;He certainly made me furious last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise frowned, but she did not tell
Jane what the young man had said about Cliff
Hunter. No use getting her chum all excited,
so she merely shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just some remarks he made,&rdquo; she replied.
&ldquo;But I really had forgotten all about the date.
When did I promise him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday afternoon, before I went off with
Cliff. Oh, come on, Mary Lou! Go along with
us. Let&rsquo;s pack a supper&mdash;it&rsquo;ll be easy with all
that food we brought back from the store.
Maybe your mother and Freckles will go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I really can&rsquo;t, Jane. I don&rsquo;t want to be
rude to you&mdash;you are my guest, I know&mdash;but
honest, this is important. That I go see old Mr.
Adams, I mean. If he has made up his mind
to burn down the entire settlement at Shady
Nook, our cottage will be included. I&rsquo;ve just
got to do something to save it&mdash;and everybody
else&rsquo;s. You know&mdash;Dad&rsquo;s counting on me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand how you feel, Mary Lou.
But you may be all wrong&mdash;these two fires may
just have been accidents&mdash;and then you&rsquo;ll be
wasting your perfectly good vacation for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;m having fun! There&rsquo;s nothing I
love better than a mystery. Only this one does
scare me a little, because we may actually be involved
in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you do whatever you want,&rdquo; Jane told
her. &ldquo;Just regard me as one of the family, and
I&rsquo;ll go my own way. I know everybody here
now, and I&rsquo;m having a grand time. Only don&rsquo;t
forget you have David McCall to reckon with
about breaking that date!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drove up to the back door of the cottage,
and Freckles, who had returned home by
this time, helped carry in the boxes. Mary
Louise asked him how he had made out with the
Flicks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so good,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sore as
anything. Still believes we had something to do
with starting the fire, though he admits he
doesn&rsquo;t think we did it on purpose. They&rsquo;re going
away today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary
Louise. &ldquo;I was hoping they would build some
kind of shack and continue to serve meals.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, they&rsquo;re not going to. They&rsquo;ve decided
to go right back to Albany, where they live in
the winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they now?&rdquo; demanded Mary
Louise. She realized that she must hurry if she
meant to interview them before they left Shady
Nook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Flick&rsquo;s on his lot, and Mrs. Flick is
over at the Partridges&rsquo;. They stayed there all
night, you know, Sis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the supplies from the store were
carefully stored away, the two girls walked over
to the spot where the Flicks&rsquo; Inn had stood. The
charred remains were pitiful to see; the fire had
been much harder on the Flicks than the Hunters&rsquo;
disaster had been for them, because the innkeeper
and his wife were poor. And what they
made in the summer went a long way toward
supporting them all the year round. Mary
Louise felt sorry for them, but nevertheless she
resented their laying the blame upon her brother.</p>
<p>The girls found Mr. Flick standing under a
tree talking to some men in overalls&mdash;working
men, whom Mary Lou remembered seeing from
time to time around the hotel across the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I talk with you for a moment, Mr.
Flick?&rdquo; inquired Mary Louise, as the former
turned around and spoke to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, Mary Louise,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t think the boys are responsible,
do you, Mr. Flick?&rdquo; she asked directly,
when he joined the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rdquo; replied the
man. &ldquo;It may have been an accident. That one
servant girl we have is awfully careless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hattie Adams. The one who waits on your
table and washes the dishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hattie Adams!&rdquo; repeated Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Lemuel Adams&rsquo; daughter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And Tom Adams&rsquo; sister.&rdquo; He lowered
his voice. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Tom over there&mdash;remember
him?&mdash;he does odd jobs for both me and Frazier
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded and glanced at the young
man. He was a big fellow with a somewhat sullen
expression. He looked something like Hattie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know Lem Adams?&rdquo; inquired
Mr. Flick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise quietly. &ldquo;But
the storekeeper over at Four Corners told me
about him. How he used to own all this land and
sold it cheap to Mr. Hunter. So he thinks maybe
Mr. Adams is burning the cottages to spite the
Hunters.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Hunter is dead!&rdquo; objected Mr. Flick.
&ldquo;And it doesn&rsquo;t spite the Hunters one bit, because
they are fully insured. That&rsquo;s the worst of it for
me. My insurance only covers my mortgage&mdash;which
Cliff Hunter happens to hold. I&rsquo;m as good
as wiped out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; said Mary Louise sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half as sorry as I am.&rdquo; He scowled.
&ldquo;And when I get to Albany I&rsquo;m going to hunt
up a lawyer. If those Smith kids did it, their
parents can pay for the damage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but they didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; protested Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad if your brother was in it too.
But if he was, he ought to be punished&mdash;though
I blame that Robby Smith as the ringleader.
Boys like those aren&rsquo;t safe to have around. They
don&rsquo;t have anybody to control them. They ought
to be locked behind the walls of a reform
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing Mary Louise could say:
the man was far too wrought up to listen to
reason. So she and Jane merely nodded goodbye
and turned away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>They stopped at the Partridges&rsquo; cottage to
see Mrs. Flick and found her much calmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I blame the Adams girl,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Hattie&rsquo;s
so careless! And she was the last one at the inn.
I never should have left her alone. But my other
waitresses wanted to get back to their hometown,
and they left early&mdash;before we did. So I
can&rsquo;t lay the blame on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t think the boys did it, do
you, Mrs. Flick?&rdquo; inquired Mary Louise anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the reassuring reply, &ldquo;even
if my husband does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness for that!&rdquo; exclaimed the
girl in relief. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to call on the
Adams family this afternoon and find out all I
can. I&rsquo;ll pump Hattie, and old Mr. Adams too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to you, my dear!&rdquo; concluded Mrs.
Flick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><i>The Crazy Woman</i></h2>
<p>Jane went off early after lunch in Cliff Hunter&rsquo;s
canoe, and Mary Louise sat on the porch
waiting for David McCall. She was still angry
at him for the way he had accused Cliff to her
the night before, but a promise is a promise,
and she meant to see him. If she had had a
chance to go swimming that morning, she might
have tried to break the date.</p>
<p>He came along about half-past two, smiling
shyly, as if he were not quite sure how he stood
with Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not still mad at me, Mary Lou, are
you?&rdquo; he asked, looking straight into her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed
that a boy with your brains can&rsquo;t reason
more intelligently. The finest detective in the
world wouldn&rsquo;t be sure that one certain person
was guilty of a crime until he had made some
investigations.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s so obvious, Mary Lou! Hunter holds
a big mortgage on one place and big fire insurance
on another. He can&rsquo;t sell either of them,
and he needs the money. So he sets them both
on fire and collects that way! What could be
simpler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are lots of other people, besides Cliff,
who profited from those two fires. In fact,&rdquo; concluded
Mary Louise, &ldquo;the thing that worries me
is that there are so many suspects. It&rsquo;s terribly
confusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David opened his eyes wide in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you!&rdquo; snapped the girl. &ldquo;Then just
listen to this bunch of names!&rdquo; She opened her
notebook and read him the list:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Horace Ditmar, Lemuel Adams, Eberhardt&rsquo;&mdash;the
storekeeper&mdash;&lsquo;Frazier, a tramp the
boys saw in the woods, and a queer-looking
woman.&rsquo; Not to mention the boys, because I
really don&rsquo;t think they did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David shook his head. &ldquo;All possible, of
course, but not any of them probable. Of course,
I understand you have reasons for suspecting
Ditmar, and I admit he is a queer cuss. Still, I
don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d do a thing like that. But tell me
why you suspect men like Adams&mdash;I suppose
he&rsquo;s the farmer, isn&rsquo;t he?&mdash;and Frazier and Eberhardt.
Sounds silly to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Frazier and Eberhardt both gained something
by the fires: more business. And Dad always
tells me to hunt for motives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t get enough business to go to
all that trouble,&rdquo; remarked David.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure. Then, the storekeeper told
me that Lemuel Adams felt spiteful towards the
Hunters because they made so much money out
of his land. So Adams may be doing it for revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly likely, when the fires actually put
money into the Hunters&rsquo; pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. Anyway, I&rsquo;m going to
do my best to find out who did it&mdash;to clear
Freckles, for one reason, and to prevent our own
bungalow from burning down, for another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry about your bungalow,&rdquo;
said David stubbornly. &ldquo;Cliff Hunter hasn&rsquo;t
any mortgage on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise gave him a scornful look. She
stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go canoeing with you, David,&rdquo; she
announced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m driving over to Adams&rsquo; farm.
You can come along with me if you want to,&rdquo;
she added grudgingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>The young man looked disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mean, Mary Lou,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My vacation&rsquo;s
nearly over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m being a lot nicer to you than you deserve,&rdquo;
she replied. &ldquo;Letting you in on all the
thrills of solving a real mystery.... Well, are
you coming or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; he muttered disconsolately.
But he gazed longingly at the river and
wished it were a canoe, and not a car, in which
they were to spend the afternoon.</p>
<p>Remembering the farmhouse where Hattie
Adams had said she lived, Mary Louise turned
off the drive beyond Shady Nook into a dirt
road which wound around to the top of a hill.
She was going slowly&mdash;in second gear&mdash;when a
strange-looking creature in a gray dress darted
out from the bushes into the direct path of the
car. With a gasp of horror, Mary Louise ground
down her brakes, missing the woman by only a
couple of inches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do that for?&rdquo; shouted David.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>The woman looked up and smiled innocently
at the two young people in the car. Her eyes
were vacant and expressionless; her gray hair
hung about her face in tangled curls, tied with
a faded blue ribbon, in a childish fashion. And
under her arm she lugged an immense china
pitcher&mdash;the kind that is used in the country
for carrying water to the bedrooms. She was
indeed a strange-looking person&mdash;probably the
same woman the boys had noticed on the road
the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better move out of the way!&rdquo; called
David.</p>
<p>The woman wagged her head confidently: evidently
she had no idea of the danger she had
just escaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for well water,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well
water to put out the dreadful fires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fires?&rdquo; repeated Mary Louise sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, fires. The Lord said in His holy Book
that He would burn down the cities of pleasure
because of the sins of the people. But I am sorry
for the little children. I must help put out the
fires with pure water from a well. I am Rebecca&mdash;at
the well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise was horror-stricken. This
woman might indeed be the &ldquo;firebug&rdquo; whom
she and Jane had considered as a possibility. Although
she seemed to want to put fires out, perhaps
she lighted them first for that very purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but we don&rsquo;t know where there
is a well,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But tell us where you
live, Rebecca. We&rsquo;ll take you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I can&rsquo;t go home. I must find water.
There will be a fire tonight, and I must be ready
to put it out. I must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where will the fire be tonight?&rdquo; demanded
Mary Louise apprehensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. One of those wicked cottages,
where the people go about half clad, and where
they dance and feast until past midnight. I
can&rsquo;t tell you upon which the Lord&rsquo;s anger will
descend, but I know it will come. I know it. I
must get water&mdash;pure water. I can&rsquo;t have innocent
children burned to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who are you?&rdquo; repeated Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Rebecca. And I am going to meet my
bridegroom at the well. My Isaac!&rdquo; Her eyes
gleamed with happiness as she trotted off down
the hill, carrying that ridiculous pitcher in her
hand.</p>
<p>David and Mary Louise sat still, looking at
each other in speechless wonder, not knowing
whether to laugh or to cry at the poor deluded
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she seems happy,&rdquo; remarked David.
&ldquo;So I guess we needn&rsquo;t pity her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s like that bride in the Dickens book,&rdquo;
said Mary Louise. &ldquo;The woman who was deserted
on her wedding day and wore her wedding
dress all the rest of her life, expecting her
bridegroom to come back. Remember? That
always gave me the creeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this woman is happier. She&rsquo;s sure she&rsquo;s
going to meet her Isaac at a well.&rdquo; He laughed.
&ldquo;No, I think we&rsquo;re more to be pitied than she
is. For if she goes around setting fire to people&rsquo;s
places&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ought to be locked up! Yet that seems
a shame, if she does happen to be harmless.&rdquo;
Mary Louise stepped on the starter. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s
go on up to the Adams&rsquo;. Maybe they can tell us
who she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They continued on up the hill to the farm and
left the car at the entrance to the front yard,
just outside the picket fence. The Adams place
was a neat-looking frame house, painted white,
and pleasant to look at. A big porch surrounded
it on all sides, and here they saw Hattie Adams,
seated in a rocking chair, sewing. She waved
to Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, folks!&rdquo; she called genially. &ldquo;Come on
up! Any news?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, we haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise as
she sat down. &ldquo;But I did want to ask you what
you knew about the fire, Hattie, because Mr.
Flick is sort of blaming my brother and the other
small boys, and I know they didn&rsquo;t start it. So
will you tell us when you left Flicks&rsquo;&mdash;and all
you know about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hattie nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let me see,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;We had supper
at half-past five last night, didn&rsquo;t we? And
everybody was through eatin&rsquo; about quarter to
seven. Even Mis&rsquo; Flick. The other two hired
girls helped me wash some of the dishes, and
then Mr. Flick drove &rsquo;em over to the Junction.
He come back for Mis&rsquo; Flick about half-past
seven, I reckon. They put the car away and
went to the picnic in a boat. I was just finishin&rsquo;
washin&rsquo; dishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the boys or anybody around at
all?&rdquo; questioned Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a soul. Everybody went to the picnic,
as far as I know. I expected to go home, get
fixed up, and get my brother Tom to row me
over. But he wasn&rsquo;t anywhere around when I
got back, and I didn&rsquo;t feel like gettin&rsquo; the boat
and goin&rsquo; all by myself, so I just stayed home
with Dad. I never knew a thing about the fire
till I went over this mornin&rsquo; as usual to work at
Flicks&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother&mdash;or your father&mdash;didn&rsquo;t know
anything about it, either?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad didn&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t know about Tom. I
didn&rsquo;t see him. He was off milkin&rsquo; the cows when
I got up, and I left before he come in for his
breakfast. I usually get it and set it on the table
and then run down to Flicks&rsquo; quick as I can.
But Mis&rsquo; Flick never cares if I don&rsquo;t get there
early, because we haven&rsquo;t many people for
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Except what I heard this mornin&rsquo; at
Shady Nook&mdash;same as you heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise sighed. She didn&rsquo;t feel as if she
were making any progress. She wanted to ask
more about Hattie&rsquo;s father&mdash;Lemuel Adams&mdash;but
she didn&rsquo;t know how. And about this brother
Tom, too. If he had been away from the farm
last night, maybe he was responsible for setting
the inn on fire.</p>
<p>Instead, however, she inquired about the
strange creature who wandered about the
countryside with her big pitcher under her arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know a woman with gray hair who
calls herself Rebecca, Hattie?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;We
almost ran over her half a mile down the road.
She stepped right in front of our car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girl laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Rebecca&rsquo;s my sister. She&rsquo;s
never been right. But she&rsquo;s perfectly harmless,
so we let her wander about as she wants. She
wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a kitten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you think she could be setting the
places on fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Hattie positively. &ldquo;Rebecca&rsquo;s
afraid of fires. She always wants to put &rsquo;em out.
No, I wouldn&rsquo;t blame her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise sighed and stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly wish we could find out what is
the cause before anything else happens,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about it if I was you,&rdquo; returned
Hattie. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t do anything to your
brother without proof.... It&rsquo;s lots worse for
me. I&rsquo;ve lost my job. And so has my brother
Tom. He used to pick up a lot of work at odd
times for Mr. Flick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise stared in surprise; she had never
thought of this angle of it. Here were two people
who actually lost out by the fire! Surely this
fact proclaimed the innocence of the entire
Adams family, with the possible exception of
Rebecca.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you need the work, Hattie?&rdquo; she asked,
gazing around at the big farm land that stretched
out on all sides of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we won&rsquo;t starve without it! But it meant
spendin&rsquo; money for Tom and me. And extra
clothes. Besides, I liked it. It&rsquo;s awful dull livin&rsquo;
on a farm with only the chores to do. I&rsquo;d go to
the city and get a job if there was any. But I
know there ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Mr. Frazier will give you a job at
the Royal Hotel,&rdquo; suggested Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Now that he has more business. Because I understand
that most of the Shady Nook people
are going to eat there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hattie wrinkled her nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate that guy. But I suppose I will ask him&mdash;it&rsquo;s
better than nuthin&rsquo;. Tom goes every other
day with butter and eggs and milk, so it would
be easy to get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good luck to you!&rdquo; was Mary Louise&rsquo;s
parting hope. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be getting on. I&rsquo;d like a
swim this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David McCall&rsquo;s eyes brightened. They were
going to have some fun, after all!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get into our suits and go out in the
canoe,&rdquo; said Mary Louise as she directed the
car towards Shady Nook. &ldquo;Maybe we can find
Jane and Cliff and all go in together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man sighed: always this Clifford
Hunter had to share his good times!</p>
<p>But it was better than nothing, and later on,
when the couple found not only Jane and Cliff,
but the Robinson boys and the Reed twins, he
had to admit that his afternoon had turned out
pleasantly after all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><i>Danger</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Freckles,&rdquo; said Mary Louise at supper that
evening, &ldquo;will you lend us your tent tonight?
Jane and I want to sleep outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane raised her eyebrows. She couldn&rsquo;t remember
expressing any such desire. But she
said nothing: she wanted to see what Mary
Louise was up to now. For her chum must have
some purpose in the request: something to do
with the mystery of the fires. It couldn&rsquo;t be just
a desire for fresh air!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; agreed her brother. &ldquo;But you
know my cot isn&rsquo;t very wide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll manage all right,&rdquo; returned Mary
Louise. &ldquo;And thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not until after supper, while the girls
were waiting for their boy-friends to come, that
Jane had a chance to ask Mary Louise why she
wanted to sleep outdoors tonight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to sleep in my clothing, Jane,&rdquo; was
the surprising reply. &ldquo;Remember the scout
motto, &lsquo;Be prepared&rsquo;? That&rsquo;s ours for tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prepared for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a fire. I think there&rsquo;s going to be one.
I&rsquo;m only hoping that it won&rsquo;t be our cottage.
But you never can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think there will be one tonight?&rdquo;
demanded Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From something I learned this afternoon
from that Adams family. You remember hearing
Freckles describing a queer creature he saw
last night on his way home from the woods?
Well, we almost ran over her this afternoon!
With her pitcher, looking for well water! &lsquo;To
put out the fires which the Lord sends upon the
wicked&rsquo; were her words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think we&rsquo;re as wicked as that, Mary
Lou?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t believe that, Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what do you believe? Why do you
think that there will be another fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that either this crazy woman sets the
cottages on fire herself, believing that she is appointed
by the Lord, or else that somebody she
knows is doing it, and she has inside information
somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;More likely she&rsquo;s just prattling,&rdquo; remarked
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so. But, anyhow, I want to be prepared
to jump up at the first sign of smoke. I&rsquo;m
going to rig up a hose with the river, so that I
can put it out if it does happen around our cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sound almost as crazy as the old lady,
Mary Lou! Next thing you&rsquo;ll be taking your
pitcher out for river water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jane, be yourself! You&rsquo;ll sleep out with
me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. But let&rsquo;s keep Silky with us,
in case one of those gypsies comes along and
grabs you, the way she did at Dark Cedars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any gypsies anywhere around
here,&rdquo; Mary Louise assured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but there&rsquo;s a tramp. Freckles saw him.
And a crazy woman. And from the way Mr.
Flick was carrying on this morning, he&rsquo;ll soon
be crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to Albany. And the crazy woman
is harmless. But you&rsquo;re wise about Silky: he will
protect us from any tramps that might show up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>To Mary Louise&rsquo;s delight, Mrs. Gay raised
no objection to the plan. After all, her daughter
had often slept outdoors before. So, after a pleasant
evening of games and dancing at the Reeds&rsquo;
cottage, the two girls went out to the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forgot your pajamas, Mary Louise!&rdquo;
called Mrs. Gay as she fixed up the girls&rsquo; room
for Freckles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; replied her daughter. No
need to alarm her mother by telling her that
they intended to sleep in their clothing.</p>
<p>They took off their shoes, changed into sweaters
and skirts, and climbed into the cot. Silky lay
down on the rug beside it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is close quarters,&rdquo; whispered Jane. &ldquo;But
nothing like that could keep me awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me either,&rdquo; returned Mary Louise, with a
yawn.</p>
<p>Five minutes later they were both sound
asleep, entirely forgetful of fires or danger. But
their rest was short. About one o&rsquo;clock Mary
Louise was awakened by a soft growl from
Silky. Instantly she sat up and peered out into
the darkness. It was utterly black at the opening
of the tent, for the night was starless, and the
trees closed out all view of the sky. Yet she perceived
something light&mdash;something white&mdash;coming
towards her. For one wild moment a terrible
thought took possession of her imagination:
Was this indeed the angel of wrath, coming to
destroy their house&mdash;as that queer woman had
predicted?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>But, no: common sense came to her rescue and
assured Mary Louise things like that didn&rsquo;t
happen nowadays. There must be some other explanation.
It must be&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>A horrible inane laugh burst upon the silence
of the night, wakening Jane with a cry of terror
on her lips. A long arm reached through the
opening of the tent, touching the girls&rsquo; cot,
snatching at their feet. Then another laugh, followed
by hysterical sobbing.</p>
<p>Mary Louise reached for the flashlight underneath
her pillow. But she was calm now; she was
sure of the identity of the intruder. It must be
the crazy woman.</p>
<p>She flashed the light into the creature&rsquo;s face,
and the woman gasped in fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t harm me! Please!&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
the Lord&rsquo;s messenger. To tell you that the
Smith&rsquo;s house is on fire. There are little children
to be rescued. Go! Run! I&rsquo;ll follow as soon as I
can fill my pitcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane and Mary Louise looked at each other
in wonder. Was what she said the truth, or only
a figment of her crazy brain?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>But they did not dare take a chance. As the
poor woman said, there were children at Smiths&rsquo;
big house on the hill: three children, two boys
and a little girl, with only servants to look after
them. And servants, unlike parents, too often
think of their own safety first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go right away, Rebecca,&rdquo; Mary Louise
assured her as she stepped into her pumps.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking only their flashlight for protection,
she and Jane ran off as fast as they could go,
with Silky faithfully following them.</p>
<p>As soon as they had passed the ruins of Flicks&rsquo;
Inn, they could see the smoke rising from the hill
beyond. There could be no doubt about it. Rebecca
was right: the Smiths&rsquo; house was on fire.</p>
<p>The girls redoubled their pace and tore up
the hill. As they came nearer they saw the flames
and heard wild shouts of excitement. Then they
met the Smith boys and several of the servants
racing madly about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it start?&rdquo; demanded Mary Louise
breathlessly as she almost bumped into Robby
Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. In the back, somehow. That&rsquo;s
all wood, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can they save it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doin&rsquo; our best. All us men are working!&rdquo;
He stuck out his chest proudly, evidently enjoying
the adventure immensely. Money was
never a thing to the Smith boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your sister?&rdquo; demanded Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Around somewhere. Everybody got out safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With her nurse?&rdquo; inquired Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Nurse took the canoe across to the Royal&mdash;to
phone to Four Corners for the fire engine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we better hunt up little Ethel and take
care of her,&rdquo; asserted Mary Louise. The child
was only four&mdash;anything might happen to her.</p>
<p>Flames were rising upward from behind the
house, lighting up the scene vividly, showing the
chauffeur, the gardener, and two maids desperately
pouring water from buckets and pails. But
Mary Louise did not see little Ethel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethel! Ethel!&rdquo; she cried wildly, raising her
voice above the shouts of the men. &ldquo;Where are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here me is!&rdquo; came a plaintive reply, and a
tiny head leaned out of a second-story window.
&ldquo;I comed up for my dolly!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>A cold chill of horror crept over Mary Louise
as she realized the dreadful peril of the child.
But without a thought for her own danger she
dashed through the front door and up the wide,
smoke-filled staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to the steps, Ethel!&rdquo; she shrieked, her
throat choking with smoke. &ldquo;Come here&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
get you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tan&rsquo;t. Too smoky,&rdquo; replied the little girl,
beginning to sob.</p>
<p>Mary Louise took one desperate leap and
dashed through the upstairs hall to the nursery.
Grabbing the child in her arms she groped her
way back to the head of the stairs.</p>
<p>She never knew how she reached the bottom
of those steps. With her hand on the railing and
her eyes tightly closed, she somehow made her
slow progress. All she could remember was
Jane&rsquo;s voice at the door as she lifted the child
from her arms. Then darkness&mdash;choking for
breath&mdash;silence, and blessed unconsciousness!</p>
<p>When Mary Louise finally came to, Rebecca
was giving her water out of her huge pitcher
and patting her shoulder gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, Mary Lou!&rdquo; cried Jane frantically.
&ldquo;Oh, say you&rsquo;re still alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; replied her chum, managing
a smile. &ldquo;And little Ethel?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine. With her nurse. She&rsquo;s back from
across the river now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise turned her head and saw the
woman at her side, clutching the child in her
arms and sobbing hysterically.</p>
<p>Other people had arrived by this time. Mr.
Frazier had come over from the Royal Hotel,
accompanied by Cliff Hunter, David McCall,
and several other young people who were staying
there, and Mr. Reed and all the Robinsons
had gathered from Shady Nook. In another
minute the fire engine from Four Corners came,
and the volunteers got the flames under control.
The front of the house was saved; only the
wooden structure at the back was completely
destroyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; Frazier was asking the
Smiths&rsquo; chauffeur, half an hour later, when the
crowd had finally gathered about Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;Everybody
here was in bed and asleep. No signs of
any prowler, either. The fire just started with the
back shed&mdash;and spread. I was the first to wake
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David McCall looked knowingly at Mary
Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No signs of anybody?&rdquo; he asked the chauffeur.
&ldquo;No clues at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe this is a clue,&rdquo; interrupted one of
the volunteer firemen, coming forward with a
small box in his hand. &ldquo;I found this pack of
cards right where the fire must have started. But
it had dropped into a pail of water&mdash;that&rsquo;s why
it wasn&rsquo;t burned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the boys were playing cards and
smoking corn silk,&rdquo; suggested Cliff Hunter
lightly.</p>
<p>The chauffeur took the box from the fireman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they ain&rsquo;t our cards,&rdquo; he said as he examined
them. &ldquo;I know ours, because I&rsquo;ve bought
them for the kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David McCall stepped nearer and uttered a
sudden exclamation of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; he said solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recognize them, McCall?&rdquo; inquired Frazier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure do. They&rsquo;re Cliff Hunter&rsquo;s. Nobody
else around here can afford to pay a dollar a
pack. Look&mdash;they&rsquo;re monogrammed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise glanced apprehensively at Cliff.
He was holding the cards in his hand, nodding
his assent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they&rsquo;re mine. The kids must have
swiped them&mdash;or maybe I lost them and they
found &rsquo;em. I myself haven&rsquo;t been up here to
Smiths&rsquo; once this summer before tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sez&mdash;you!&rdquo; muttered David McCall under
his breath. But not too low for Mary Louise to
hear him and be genuinely frightened!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><i>The Arrest</i></h2>
<p>When the girls came home from the fire that
night they found Mrs. Gay and Freckles both
awake and dressed. The boy was pleading with
his mother to be allowed to go to the Smiths&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; announced Jane, sinking
wearily into the swing on the porch. &ldquo;Mary Lou
passed out for a few minutes, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay uttered an exclamation of alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;m all right now, Mother,&rdquo; her
daughter hastened to assure her. &ldquo;Only I would
like something hot to drink. And my own bed
to sleep in, if Freckles doesn&rsquo;t mind changing
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hot drink?&rdquo; repeated her brother, in
amazement. &ldquo;Why hot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Briefly Jane told the story of Mary Louise&rsquo;s
daring act of heroism, and Mrs. Gay hurried off
to make her daughter comfortable for the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>In their own soft bed again, the girls slept
soundly until nearly noon the following day.
Mary Louise was vexed with herself for wasting
so much time when she saw the lateness of the
hour. For if she was to do anything about solving
the mystery of the fires she hadn&rsquo;t a single
minute to lose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard any news this morning?&rdquo; she
demanded of her brother as the family all ate
their breakfast-lunch together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; replied the boy. &ldquo;We went over
to see the place, of course, as soon as we were
up this morning. It must have been some fire!
What&rsquo;s left of the house isn&rsquo;t fit to live in....
Gee, Sis, you and Jane were lucky to be in on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky for the Smiths!&rdquo; amended Mrs. Gay.
&ldquo;I shudder every time I think of what might
have happened to little Ethel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the Smiths now?&rdquo; inquired Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moved over to the hotel. The chauffeur telegraphed
Mr. Smith, and he and Mrs. Smith are
coming this afternoon, with clothes and stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the boys this morning?&rdquo; questioned
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; replied the boy. &ldquo;I took the canoe
across the river, where they were in swimming
early, with the chauffeur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And couldn&rsquo;t they tell you anything more
about the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. Robby said he never wakened up till
he heard the chauffeur yelling at them. Then
they all grabbed their clothes and ran. The nurse
was sleeping in the same room with little Ethel,
and she saw to it that the kid got out safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she went back for her dolly!&rdquo; whispered
Mrs. Gay, with a catch in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, please stop thinking about that!&rdquo;
begged Mary Louise. &ldquo;Everything came out all
right&mdash;so do try to forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, dear. But I think I&rsquo;ve had enough
of Shady Nook for one summer. I&rsquo;ve about
decided to pack up and go home tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; protested Mary Louise, aghast.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t&mdash;run away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only your father were here, he&rsquo;d find out
what&rsquo;s the cause of all these disasters. But I feel
so unsafe&mdash;so helpless without him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out!&rdquo; announced Mary
Louise, with determination in her voice. &ldquo;Just
stay a little while, till we have a chance to see
what develops!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t promise. By the way, I&rsquo;ve decided
that we&rsquo;ll all go over to the Royal Hotel for
dinner tonight. It will be a nice change&mdash;and
you girls can dance afterwards, because practically
everybody from Shady Nook eats there
now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody except the Ditmars,&rdquo; said Mary
Louise, with a significant look at Jane.</p>
<p>She said nothing further about the young
couple now, but an hour later, when the two
girls were getting into their bathing suits, she
mentioned the Ditmars again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that the criminal,
the person responsible for the fires, is one of
two people,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with the possible chance
of a third.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You suspect Horace Ditmar, of course?&rdquo;
asked Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I think everything points to him. First,
he has the <i>motive</i>. To get work for himself&mdash;to
plan new houses to take the place of those
that have been destroyed. If you&rsquo;ve noticed,
Jane, the three places that have been burned
have all been big, expensive ones. The finest at
Shady Nook! The Smiths and the Hunters are
rich people, well able to afford to rebuild. And
Flicks&rsquo; was such a flourishing business that anybody
would naturally expect them to want to
start it up again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Next, Horace Ditmar had the <i>opportunity</i>.
He was absent from the two parties which were
going on when the Hunters&rsquo; and Flicks&rsquo; places
burned, and he could easily have slipped out
last night and set Smiths&rsquo; on fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And last&mdash;and most important of all, Dad
often says&mdash;Ditmar&rsquo;s the kind of man who could
do it. Quiet, almost sullen, I think, and deceitful.
I&rsquo;ve never spoken two words with him, but
that&rsquo;s my opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane nodded solemnly: her chum&rsquo;s logic appeared
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But still,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;Horace Ditmar
isn&rsquo;t profiting any by these fires. Nobody seems
a bit inclined to rebuild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Not yet. But wait till the Smiths come,
and see whether Horace Ditmar tries to chum
up with them. You know Adelaide Ditmar admitted
that they went over to call on Mrs.
Hunter after their fire and the woman almost
snubbed her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True.... Who&rsquo;s your other suspect, Mary
Lou? Is it&mdash;Cliff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Positively not Cliff! In spite of that
pack of cards they found over there last night.
Imagine Cliff Hunter setting fire to a house that
had three children asleep in it! It&rsquo;s unthinkable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Jane breathed a sigh of relief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to
hear you say that,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other person I suspect strongly is Rebecca
Adams,&rdquo; continued the young detective.
&ldquo;I hate to, for she seems harmless, but you just
never can tell about a half-witted person like
that. She wanders around at such queer times,
and then her coming here last night, after predicting
a fire in the afternoon, looks bad. She&rsquo;s
got to be watched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right again,&rdquo; agreed the other girl admiringly.
&ldquo;But go on, &lsquo;Spencer Dean&rsquo;! Who&rsquo;s your
third suspect&mdash;the one you called a possible
chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hotelkeeper, Frazier. It&rsquo;s meant a lot to
his business. He has the motive all right, but I
just can&rsquo;t see how he could have actually accomplished
setting the places on fire. He was with
us all evening the night Flicks&rsquo; burned down,
and Cliff says he was at the hotel when the Hunters&rsquo;
cottage burned. Still, Frazier&rsquo;s sly. He might
have managed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to take a good look at him tonight
when we go over to dinner,&rdquo; observed Jane, &ldquo;and
try to size up his character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise reached for her beach robe and
stepped into her slippers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Jane,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to
hurry, or the crowd will go home before we get
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ran out to the canoe and jumped in,
paddling down the river half a mile to the spot
which was generally accepted as the best swimming
place near Shady Nook. Here they found
about twenty-five people gathered on the shore,
all talking in the wildest excitement. And not a
single person was in the water!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; demanded Jane. &ldquo;Anybody
drowned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another fire?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; explained Sue Reed, turning to
the newcomers. &ldquo;But something almost as bad.
A detective arrived from Albany and arrested
Cliff Hunter! As an incendiary, I believe he
said. A person who sets things on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; gasped Jane in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could he?&rdquo; cried Mary Louise incredulously.
&ldquo;I mean, how could a detective
from Albany know about the fires here at Shady
Nook&mdash;let alone suspect Cliff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody wired,&rdquo; said Sue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded both girls in the same
breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Nobody seemed to be able to answer that question.
All anyone knew was that Cliff had gone
off in the detective&rsquo;s car and that his mother had
insisted upon going with him. Mrs. Hunter was
positive that it was all a put-up job, a plot of
some kind to kidnap her son.</p>
<p>The talking died down at last, and the crowd
dispersed into the water. But nobody seemed to
enjoy the swim that day. Discouraged and worried,
Mary Louise and Jane decided to paddle
back home in their canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All your detective work gone for nothing!&rdquo;
lamented Jane miserably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just like to know,
who&rsquo;s responsible for that arrest! It was such a
dirty trick. I wonder if it was one of the Smiths&rsquo;
servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m going to find out tonight,&rdquo;
returned Mary Louise. &ldquo;Thank goodness
we&rsquo;re going to the Royal to dinner, where we&rsquo;ll
see everybody! Keep your eyes and ears open,
Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the girls reached their cottage they
told Mrs. Gay the startling news about Cliff
Hunter. She was as much distressed as they were
over the announcement, for she had known the
young man so long that he seemed almost like a
son. And, like the girls, she was positive of his
innocence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get dressed early and go over to the
hotel. Maybe we can find out something there,&rdquo;
she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what we&rsquo;re hoping,&rdquo; replied Jane.
&ldquo;And believe me, if we find that the Smith
chauffeur is responsible&mdash;or that sneaky Frazier&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Mr. Frazier, I can assure you,&rdquo; interrupted
Mary Louise. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be losing money
without the Hunters and their friends. No&mdash;but
maybe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. No use of making guesses in the
dark. We&rsquo;ll wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls went into their room to dress. Mary
Louise was surprised to see Jane take a simple
white voile out of the closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jane, we&rsquo;re going to the Royal Hotel!
To dine and dance. Don&rsquo;t you want to wear your
pink georgette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her chum shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. White&rsquo;s more appropriate for the way I
feel tonight. I&rsquo;m not in a party mood. Maybe
I&rsquo;d wear black, if I had it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise lowered her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you care that much about Cliff, Jane?&rdquo;
she asked seriously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that part of it, Mary Lou&mdash;but
I do feel dreadfully. Cliff was always so
care-free and happy&mdash;just like a child with his
card tricks. And then for somebody to pounce
down on him like that and carry him off without
any chance to defend himself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about that, Jane,&rdquo; interrupted
Mary Louise. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that the Hunters
are rich, and Mrs. Hunter will hire the best
lawyer in the whole state of New York to defend
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s comforting! But, just the same,
it was a mean trick. And I&rsquo;m going to miss Cliff
dreadfully.... By the way, where was David
McCall today? I didn&rsquo;t see him in swimming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise frowned. &ldquo;Neither did I,&rdquo; she
muttered.</p>
<p>Jane swung about sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Lou, you think David sent that wire,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying not to think so!&rdquo; responded her
chum. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll find out tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were ready in a few minutes, but
they waited for Mrs. Gay and Freckles. They
had expected to go across the river in the canoes,
but Stuart Robinson stopped in to invite them
to join their family in the motorboat, so that
there was further delay. Instead of getting off
early, the party did not leave until after six.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Naturally, everybody talked of the arrest on
the way over, but none of the Robinsons knew
who was responsible for it. Stuart blamed it
upon the Smiths&rsquo; servants.</p>
<p>When they reached the porch of the hotel,
they found it deserted. Everybody ate early at
the resort.</p>
<p>The large dining room, with its pale yellow
walls, its long screened windows, and its snow-white
tables, was certainly a pleasant-looking
place. The floors were of polished hardwood,
so that when these same tables were removed the
room was fine for dancing. The space was ample,
too, for it was intended to accommodate a couple
of hundred people at a meal. Tonight it looked
fairly well filled, with all the guests from Shady
Nook in addition to the regular diners.</p>
<p>Mr. Frazier himself came up and found two
tables for the Gays and the Robinsons. The little
man looked happy and confident tonight,
pleased, no doubt, that business was more flourishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is David McCall here, Mr. Frazier?&rdquo; asked
Jane abruptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sitting with the
Smiths this evening. Mr. and Mrs. Smith arrived
this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; answered Jane, without going
into any explanation.</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled. &ldquo;Nothing like going
right to the point, Jane,&rdquo; she remarked when the
hotelkeeper had turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to ask David point-blank! I hope I
can make him ashamed of himself, if he did
cause Cliff&rsquo;s arrest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; put in Mrs.
Gay wisely. &ldquo;These self-righteous people who
feel that it is their duty to tell on others&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She stopped, wondering whether she was hurting
Mary Louise&rsquo;s feelings by speaking thus about
David McCall, but her daughter was scarcely
listening. &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;ll come over to see us,&rdquo;
Mrs. Gay concluded as she gave her order to
the waitress, &ldquo;with the Smiths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay was correct in her surmise: when
the Smiths had finished their dinner, they came
straight to the Gays&rsquo; table.</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith, a well-dressed woman of perhaps
thirty-five&mdash;though she looked much younger&mdash;put
her hand on Mary Louise&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can never thank you enough for saving my
baby, Mary Louise,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;All my life I&rsquo;ll
be grateful to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thankful I was there in time, Mrs.
Smith,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ethel is such a darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could do something for you, Mary
Lou,&rdquo; put in her husband. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you think of
something you want?&rdquo; He was too well bred to
offer her a reward in money, the way old Miss
Mattie Grant at Dark Cedars had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I want is to find out who really did start
that fire at your house,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;Because
I&rsquo;m sure Cliff Hunter didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was staring past Mrs. Smith right at
David McCall as she said this, with scorn in her
eyes.</p>
<p>Jane couldn&rsquo;t keep quiet any longer. She
turned angrily to the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you responsible for Cliff&rsquo;s arrest, David
McCall?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he stated calmly. &ldquo;I did it to protect
our insurance company. It just happens that our
company holds most of the insurance up here at
Shady Nook. And they&rsquo;ve paid enough already&mdash;or
will pay. So I don&rsquo;t want any more fires.
It&rsquo;s my duty to protect their interests.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah?&rdquo; retorted Jane, hot with fury.
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not doing it! Cliff Hunter never
started those fires, and you&rsquo;ll find out soon he&rsquo;s
innocent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; demanded David.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be another fire, just the same. We
haven&rsquo;t got the guilty person yet. I know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay shuddered. &ldquo;Oh, I hope not!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;But I believe we&rsquo;ll go home tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re planning to stay on here at the Royal
while we see about repairing the damage,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Smith. &ldquo;But if it isn&rsquo;t safe&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the hotel&rsquo;s safe enough,&rdquo; put in her
husband. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s practically fireproof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David turned nonchalantly to Mary Louise.
&ldquo;Will you dance with me after supper, Mary
Lou?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my last night here. I&rsquo;m
going to Albany tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I care to dance,&rdquo; replied the
girl icily&mdash;to Jane&rsquo;s infinite delight. &ldquo;Jane and
I are going to stay with Mother this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party moved on, and Jane reached for
her chum&rsquo;s hand under the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s telling him!&rdquo; she murmured in deep
satisfaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><i>The Visit with Rebecca</i></h2>
<p>The following morning Mrs. Gay relented
from her decision to pack up the family&rsquo;s things
and go home immediately. It was such a perfect
day; the river sparkled beautifully in the sunlight,
the birds sang sweetly in the trees beside
the cottage, and her children seemed happy. Yes,
it would be absurd to run away from all this
beauty.</p>
<p>Mary Louise was overjoyed at her mother&rsquo;s
decision. Immediately she began to make important
plans for the day. She would go over to
Adams&rsquo; farm and find out where Rebecca was.
If necessary, she could have the boys trail her
during the day, in case the crazy woman might
be planning another fire for tonight. Then she
would call on the Ditmars and make it a point to
talk to the man himself. Maybe she&rsquo;d run over
to Eberhardt&rsquo;s store at Four Corners, later in
the afternoon, just to check up on his business.
Oh, it promised to be an interesting day for
Mary Louise!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where will the &lsquo;Wild Guys of the Road&rsquo; be
today?&rdquo; she asked her brother at breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over at our cabin, I guess,&rdquo; replied Freckles.
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may want to call on you for some sleuthing,&rdquo;
explained Mary Louise. &ldquo;I am a little suspicious
about Rebecca Adams&mdash;that queer-looking
woman you boys saw the night Flicks&rsquo;
Inn burned down. Remember her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I do! Nobody&rsquo;d forget a scarecrow like
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you stay around here, where I can get
hold of you, while I drive over to Adams&rsquo; farm
right after breakfast. If I can locate her, I&rsquo;d like
you boys to keep your eyes on her all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freckles&rsquo; face lighted up with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can count on us, Sis!&rdquo; he assured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks a lot. Now, you help Mother with
the dishes, and I&rsquo;ll run along. Want to come with
me, Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; replied her chum. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really interested
in the mystery of the fires. I admit now
that they couldn&rsquo;t all be accidents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d kind of like to prove Cliff Hunter
is innocent, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Jane?&rdquo; teased
Freckles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally! Who wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; was the retort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Mary Louise backed the car out of the garage
and followed the same road she and David McCall
had taken on their first visit to Adams&rsquo;
farm. She drove very cautiously now, almost as
if she expected Rebecca Adams to dart out again
from the bushes into the path of her car.</p>
<p>But nothing happened, and the girls reached
the top of the hill in safety. An old man was sitting
out on the porch with one leg propped up
on a chair. A young man was standing on the
steps talking to him. He was a big fellow in
overalls; Mary Louise remembered seeing him
at Flicks&rsquo; the day after the fire. He must be Hattie&rsquo;s
brother Tom.</p>
<p>The girls left the car at the fence and approached
timidly, not quite sure how they would
be received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; began Jane briskly, to hide
her nervousness. &ldquo;Is Hattie home today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked questioningly at his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen her since breakfast, Tom?&rdquo; he
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; replied the young man. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s still in
the kitchen, or else upstairs with Rebecca....
Well, I&rsquo;ll be movin&rsquo; on, Dad. I&rsquo;ll be away all
afternoon&mdash;the hired man&rsquo;ll have to look after
things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four Corners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom shrugged his shoulders: he wasn&rsquo;t going
to tell his business in front of strangers, Mary
Louise decided. Then he shuffled off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that you get back in time for the milkin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
was his father&rsquo;s command. &ldquo;And stop around at
the back now and call to Hattie. Tell her she&rsquo;s
got visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise and Jane sat down on the step
and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad about that fire night before last,&rdquo; remarked
the old man. &ldquo;Lucky thing they saved
the little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Mary Louise who did that,&rdquo; announced
Jane proudly, nodding towards her
chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm! You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; returned Mr. Adams.
&ldquo;Well, I reckon girls are braver&rsquo;n boys nowadays.
My Hattie&rsquo;s a good girl, too. Can&rsquo;t say
anything ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, everybody likes Hattie,&rdquo; agreed
Mary Louise instantly. She wished that she
could ask Mr. Adams about his other daughter&mdash;Rebecca&mdash;but
she didn&rsquo;t know just how to begin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>Jane, however, came bluntly to the point, as
usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Adams,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;may I ask a question?
You wouldn&rsquo;t mind&mdash;if it was something
about your family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what it is, miss. It&rsquo;s about my daughter
Rebecca, ain&rsquo;t it? Yes, go ahead. I ain&rsquo;t sensitive
about her&mdash;we ought to be used to her by
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Jane. &ldquo;Do you think
she could be starting the fires? Do you know, she
warned Mary Louise day before yesterday there
would be another fire? And of course there was.
And then she came to our tent that night and
wakened us up to tell us that Smiths&rsquo; house was
on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Adams nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can believe it. But I don&rsquo;t think Rebecca
would ever set anything on fire. She&rsquo;s afraid of
&rsquo;em. She won&rsquo;t even light the stove or do any
cookin&rsquo; for that very reason. Many&rsquo;s the time
she&rsquo;s come in with her pitcher of water and
poured it right on the coals in the stove. It&rsquo;s aggravatin&rsquo;
if you&rsquo;re ready to get dinner. Hattie
and me have both slapped her for doin&rsquo; it, but
she keeps right on.... No, I don&rsquo;t see how we
could lay the blame on poor old Rebecca.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say that,&rdquo; said Mary
Louise. &ldquo;She seems like such a happy, harmless
creature that it would be a shame to shut her up
somewhere or accuse her of a crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say she is home now?&rdquo; inquired
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s upstairs in bed with a sore throat,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Adams. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why Hattie&rsquo;s stayin&rsquo;
around&mdash;and because my rheumatism is bad
ag&rsquo;in. Otherwise I reckon she&rsquo;d be over to the
Royal trying to get work. She was sorry to lose
her job at Flicks&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she told us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl herself appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello, girls!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Glad to
see you. Come on into the kitchen. I&rsquo;m fixin&rsquo;
some broth for Rebecca. She&rsquo;s upstairs sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls entered the old farmhouse and
followed Hattie through the hall, back into the
old-fashioned kitchen. It was a large room, with
several chairs near the windows, and Mary
Louise and Jane sat down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to be frank with you, Hattie,&rdquo;
began Mary Louise, &ldquo;and tell you why we&rsquo;ve
come. You&rsquo;ve heard, I suppose, that they arrested
Cliff Hunter on the charge of burning
three houses, and Jane and I believe he&rsquo;s innocent.
So we want to find out who really is responsible.
We thought there might just be a
chance that it was Rebecca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you for thinking that,&rdquo; agreed
the girl. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sure she couldn&rsquo;t be guilty of
that particular thing. She&rsquo;s crazy enough to do
it&mdash;only she&rsquo;s scared of fires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so your father said. But she must know
something, or how could she predict when they
are going to occur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s always predicting them,&rdquo; laughed Hattie.
&ldquo;Even when there aren&rsquo;t any. And sometimes
when it&rsquo;s just a fire to toast marshmallows she
gets all excited and swears it&rsquo;s the wrath of
heaven descending on Shady Nook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She came and warned us about the Smiths&rsquo;,&rdquo;
put in Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She probably saw the flames. Sometimes she
gets up in the middle of the night and goes out
with her pitcher. She was probably wandering
around that night. I guess that&rsquo;s how she caught
her sore throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded. &ldquo;Could we go upstairs
and see her when you take up her broth?&rdquo; she
inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. But I&rsquo;m afraid you won&rsquo;t get much
sense out of her today. She has a slight fever, and
her mind&rsquo;s wandering a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the girls followed Hattie up the
carpeted staircase to a room on the second floor.
The blinds at the windows were pulled down,
but they could see Rebecca&rsquo;s face, surrounded
by its tangled gray curls, on the pillow. She was
muttering to herself when they entered the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s some chicken broth for you, Rebecca,&rdquo;
said Hattie cheerfully. &ldquo;And a couple of
visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman stared at the girls blankly, and
then shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know them,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do!&rdquo; insisted Hattie, pulling
up the window shade. &ldquo;These are the girls who
saved the little child at the Smith fire the other
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca sat up and peered at them. Suddenly
a smile broke over her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh, yes!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I do remember.
Mr. and Mrs. Smith are wicked people,
traveling off and leaving their children alone,
and the Lord sent a fire to punish them. But I
put the fire out with my well water, and these
girls saved the baby. Yes, yes, I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Hattie straightened her sister&rsquo;s pillow and
handed her the tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me my well water,&rdquo; commanded the
woman, indicating the familiar pitcher which
she always carried with her about the countryside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell us where you were when that
fire started?&rdquo; asked Mary Louise. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you
go to bed that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman sipped her broth slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said finally. &ldquo;I was sittin&rsquo;
on the porch till Tom come home. About midnight,
I guess you call it. And then it seemed as
if I could see smoke over at Shady Nook. We&rsquo;re
high up here on the hill; we can look down on
the wickedness of you people in the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane repressed a giggle. Without noticing it,
Rebecca continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I picked up my pitcher and ran down the
hill to Shady Nook to warn the people. I saw
Smiths&rsquo; house burnin&rsquo; then, and I heard folks
shoutin&rsquo;. So I run along and tried all the doors
at Shady Nook. All of &rsquo;em was locked. Then I
looked in that tent and found you girls sleepin&rsquo;
and give you the warnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Apparently exhausted with the effort of eating
and talking, she dropped over on her pillow
asleep. Hattie picked up the tray, and the girls
followed her out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could talk to your brother,&rdquo; remarked
Mary Louise as they reentered the
kitchen. &ldquo;If he was out late that night, maybe
he saw the fire start. Maybe he knows something&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t out at all,&rdquo; laughed Hattie.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t depend on what Rebecca says. For
the most part she&rsquo;s sensible, but sometimes she
gets sadly muddled. Especially about fires.
That&rsquo;s the one subject in particular that she&rsquo;s
hipped about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess we better be going, Hattie,&rdquo;
concluded Mary Louise, &ldquo;if we want a swim this
morning. Why don&rsquo;t you come over and go in
with the crowd, now that you haven&rsquo;t any job?
We&rsquo;d like to have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks awfully,&rdquo; returned the girl, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve
got to stay here. Tom&rsquo;s gone off in the Ford, and
I have to look after things. Dad can&rsquo;t even cook
his lunch, on account of his rheumatism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did your brother go?&rdquo; inquired Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four Corners, I think. He likes to play cards
over there. I&rsquo;m afraid he gambles. Dad doesn&rsquo;t
know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>No sooner were the girls out of the gate than
Jane asked her chum why she had shown any interest
in Tom Adams&rsquo; whereabouts. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
suspect him, do you?&rdquo; she questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect everybody,&rdquo; returned the other
girl laughingly. &ldquo;No, I really don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she corrected,
&ldquo;because Tom Adams lost a job by
Flicks&rsquo; burning down. That won&rsquo;t be so nice for
him, especially if he likes to gamble and needs
the money to pay his debts. But I just thought
he might know something, if he really was out
till after midnight the night before last. He
might even be protecting somebody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I suppose we have to go to Four Corners
this afternoon?&rdquo; sighed Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till after we call on the Ditmars,&rdquo; replied
Mary Louise. &ldquo;And a swim and a lunch
come before that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><i>Adelaide Ditmar&rsquo;s Plan</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There are four new young men at the Royal,&rdquo;
announced Jane as she set the table for lunch
after their swim that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? How do you know?&rdquo; demanded Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sue Reed told me. She says they used to come
to Flicks&rsquo; every summer for two weeks&rsquo; vacation.
So instead they are staying one week at the
Royal Hotel. I don&rsquo;t know their names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her chum nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know now. I can&rsquo;t think of their names
either, but they&rsquo;ll probably come to me. They&rsquo;re
Harrisburg people.... But, Jane, how can
you take an interest in men when your own boy-friend
is in such trouble? Last night you seemed
so sad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be sad all the time,&rdquo; replied the
other girl. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t help Cliff any. Besides, I
wasn&rsquo;t engaged to him, so I can get a kick out of
meeting new men. Can&rsquo;t you, Mary Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I can at the present moment.
I&rsquo;ve too much else to think about. But what do
you want me to do about them, Jane? Have a
party and invite them over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, nothing like that. Sue asked me to
come to her cottage this afternoon to meet them.
She said to tell you to come along, in case she
didn&rsquo;t see you to invite you herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise set a plate of chicken salad on
the table. &ldquo;It does look good, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she remarked&mdash;&ldquo;if
I do say it myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yum! Yum!&rdquo; agreed Jane. &ldquo;But what makes
you think you don&rsquo;t want to go over to the Reeds&rsquo;
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;I have other plans for this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mystery of the fires!&rdquo; cried Jane, rolling
her eyes. &ldquo;Oh, Mary Lou, forget it for a while
and have some fun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve got to have a talk with the
Ditmars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better stay away from them!&rdquo; warned
Jane. &ldquo;You never can tell what that man might
do if he got desperate!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Nevertheless, Mary Louise was firm in her
resolution not to join the young people, and she
was thankful that she had stayed home, for no
sooner had Jane gone to the Reeds&rsquo; and her
mother to the Partridges&rsquo; than Mrs. Ditmar herself
came to the Gays&rsquo; bungalow!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mary Louise, I&rsquo;m so glad to find you
alone!&rdquo; exclaimed the young woman. &ldquo;Have you
any engagement, or can I talk to you for a
while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a thing to do but knit,&rdquo; replied
Mary Louise, smiling to herself. &ldquo;Jane has gone
over to the Reeds&rsquo; to dance, but I was sort of
tired, so I thought I&rsquo;d just take it easy. And I&rsquo;ll
be delighted to have you, Adelaide.&rdquo; She addressed
Mrs. Ditmar by her first name, for
though she had a prefix of &ldquo;Mrs.,&rdquo; she was,
after all, hardly more than a girl. And Mary
Louise wanted to make her feel at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; replied the visitor, sinking
into a chair with a sigh of content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I haven&rsquo;t any friends up here at
Shady Nook,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s turned
out right. I thought Horace and I would have a
lovely time with the young people&mdash;belong to
the crowd and have lots of fun. But everybody
avoids us. It&rsquo;s all Horace&rsquo;s fault, of course, for
people were friendly at first. But when you repeatedly
turn down invitations and are grouchy
when you do go anywhere, naturally nobody invites
you again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wicked shame&mdash;for you, I mean!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I can&rsquo;t blame Horace entirely. It&rsquo;s
circumstances. Nothing turned out right,&rdquo; she
repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me how you happened to come here,
Adelaide,&rdquo; urged Mary Louise. She wanted to
hear the story from the girl&rsquo;s own lips, to see
whether it coincided with Cliff Hunter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Horace is an architect, you know,&rdquo; began
Adelaide. &ldquo;And he did some work for Mr.
Hunter last fall, just before we were married
and before Mr. Hunter died. Mr. Hunter was
so pleased with it that he gave Horace a little
piece of land up here as an extra bonus, to build
a cottage for ourselves, and he got Mr. Robinson
to let him design his too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got married, and everything went finely
until Mr. Hunter died. Then Horace didn&rsquo;t
have much work. But Mr. Hunter had indicated
that it would be good business for us to live up
here during the summer and meet wealthy people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of us are far from wealthy!&rdquo; put in
Mary Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know that. We judged everybody
to be like the Hunters. Besides, Mr. Hunter said
that he owned a lot more land around Shady
Nook, and as he sold it off in lots, he&rsquo;d see that
Horace got the contracts to design the new cottages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came up early in the spring, and Horace
enjoyed designing our bungalow and the Robinsons&rsquo;.
We had enough money left to see us
through the summer, but no prospects for the
fall, unless something unexpected turned up....
Then Horace began to worry....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, we thought Mrs. Hunter would
be nice to us, but she was horrible. Just icy. I
really think she believes Horace started that fire
just to get the contract to build her a new cottage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise flushed. It was amazing to have
Adelaide Ditmar calmly state the suspicion
which was being whispered behind her back.
It almost proved her husband&rsquo;s innocence, she
thought. Evidently Adelaide did not notice
Mary Louise&rsquo;s embarrassment, for she continued
her recital in the same tone of voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to tell you so much of my troubles,
Mary Louise,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a reason for
it. I have a plan, and I thought maybe you&rsquo;d help
me carry it out. You&rsquo;re so popular that anything
you took a hand in would be sure to be a success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Popular?&rdquo; repeated Mary Louise in amazement.
Even if she were, she wondered how popularity
could help solve Adelaide Ditmar&rsquo;s worries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to make some money to help Horace,
and I think I see a way. Before I was married,
I took a course in home economics, and I was assistant
director of a Y.W.C.A. dining room. So
you see I really do know something about food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Mary Louise did not see what on earth
she was driving at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;d like to start a dining room here at
Shady Nook, now that the inn has been destroyed.
No boarders, like Flicks&rsquo;, but just lunch
and dinner service. I believe we could do it by
using our living room and dining room and
porch. That young Adams man&mdash;Tom, I believe
his name is&mdash;could knock together some benches
and tables for us, and we could gather up enough
dishes, I think. Would you&mdash;go into it with me,
Mary Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise was startled by the suggestion.
What an idea! Yet she could not help admiring
Adelaide&rsquo;s courage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You really are serious?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It would
mean an awful lot of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that! But I don&rsquo;t have enough to
do now.... Yes, I&rsquo;ve thought it all out. We
could hire Hattie Adams to wash dishes, and I
could cook, and you and Jane could wait on the
tables.... Would you, Mary Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the other hesitatingly.
&ldquo;Maybe&mdash;if Mother is willing.... Does your
husband approve, Adelaide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, he&rsquo;s keen about it! He has promised
to do anything he can to help me. Buy all our
supplies for us, and keep accounts, and even take
turn in washing dishes, if we need him.... Oh,
Mary Louise, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adelaide seized her hand excitedly, and Mary
Louise could not bear to refuse point-blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Frazier won&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares about that old stiff?&rdquo; returned the
other girl. &ldquo;He has no business to charge such
terrible prices. I&rsquo;ll bet the people of Shady
Nook will be glad to get out of paying them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Mary Louise hesitated. Was this plan
just another proof of the Ditmars&rsquo; guilt in the
burning of the cottages? No; that didn&rsquo;t seem
possible. Whatever crime Horace Ditmar might
commit, Mary Louise felt sure that his charming
wife could have no part in it. And she longed
dreadfully to help her out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk it over with Mother and Jane,&rdquo; she
finally agreed, &ldquo;and let you know tonight after
supper. Will you be home then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed! Horace and I will be waiting
for you on the porch of our bungalow....
And now I must go, Mary Louise, and talk over
the plans with him. I&rsquo;m really thrilled about it&mdash;it&rsquo;ll
give us a new interest in life. Oh, I do
hope you&rsquo;ll decide to help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, pressing Mary Louise&rsquo;s hand affectionately,
she darted off down the steps.</p>
<p>For a long time Mary Louise sat still, her
knitting lying forgotten in her lap, while she
thought over Adelaide&rsquo;s startling proposition.
Maybe it was the best thing in the world that
could have happened; perhaps fate was playing
right into her hands. The opportunity to know
and to watch Horace Ditmar would be perfect;
if he really were guilty, she surely ought to be
able to find it out upon such close association.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>But, on the other hand, the work would take a
great deal of time. Time from recreation, time
from following up other clues that might transpire
concerning other suspects. Her mother
would probably disapprove, and no doubt Jane
would object. Well, she wouldn&rsquo;t insist upon
Jane&rsquo;s helping her; no doubt Mabel Reed would
jump at the chance of making some extra money,
for she expected to earn her own way through
college.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;d give it a try, she finally decided as she
folded up her knitting and put it back into her
bag. Now she must turn her attention to other
matters. She wanted to drive over to Four Corners
and ask the storekeeper some questions
about Tom Adams. And possibly have a talk
with the young man himself.</p>
<p>She wished she had kept Freckles with her,
even though she didn&rsquo;t need him to trail Rebecca
Adams. With Jane over at the Reeds&rsquo;, she
would have to drive to Four Corners alone. But,
after all, it wasn&rsquo;t much of a trip&mdash;only four or
five miles at the most.</p>
<p>She found a list of needed groceries on a pad
in the kitchen which her mother kept for that
very purpose, and took her own pocketbook.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later she drew up at the entrance
to the store. As Jane had remarked, Eberhardt&rsquo;s
looked like anything but a grocery store.
It was an old-fashioned country house with a
wide front porch, and although Mary Louise
had never noticed it before, there was a screened-in
porch around at the side, partially hidden by
a huge elm tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>As she locked her car she heard voices from
this porch: men&rsquo;s voices; and the remark which
one of them made caused her to listen in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of your card tricks, Tom Adams!&rdquo;
he sneered. &ldquo;Think you&rsquo;ll make me fergit them
hundred berries you owe me? Well, I ain&rsquo;t
a-goin&rsquo; a fergit it! You pay me by tonight, or
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll what?&rdquo; drawled Tom Adams in a
voice which Mary Louise instantly recognized
from having heard it that morning. &ldquo;Beat me
up?&rdquo; His laugh was contemptuous. Evidently
the other fellow was a little man, Mary Louise
decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that nobody ever plays another game
with you, Tom Adams, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do! A
liar and a cheat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there!&rdquo; interrupted the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
a-goin&rsquo; a pay you, Bill! Don&rsquo;t I always square up
my debts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always win,&rdquo; returned his accuser. &ldquo;This
is my first streak of luck in a year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m payin&rsquo; you tomorrow, after I collect a
little bill a guy owes me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A little bill? Who around here could owe
you a hundred smackers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of your business&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice from the store interrupted this argument.
&ldquo;Boys, boys! Not so much noise!&rdquo; called
the storekeeper.</p>
<p>Mary Louise, realizing that she had been sitting
in her car for several minutes, got out and
went into the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a card party you have out there, Mr.
Eberhardt,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Those boys are gettin&rsquo; too old fer that
sort of thing. I let &rsquo;em play games there when
they was nuthin&rsquo; but kids, but now they&rsquo;re
growed up, and it gives my store a bad look.
Harmless, of course, but I reckon I better put a
stop to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so harmless if they gamble to the extent
of owing each other a hundred dollars,&rdquo; remarked
Mary Louise shrewdly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you must be mistaken about that, Miss
Gay. That was only their little joke. Nobody
round here has a hundred dollars to throw
away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>Mary Louise smiled and pretended not to have
any further interest in the matter. Nor did she
ask Mr. Eberhardt any questions about Tom
Adams&mdash;for it wasn&rsquo;t necessary. She had learned
plenty about the young man for herself! So she
merely handed the storekeeper her list, paid her
bill, and departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Tom Adams does card tricks!&rdquo; she muttered
to herself as she started the car. &ldquo;With Cliff
Hunter&rsquo;s cards, no doubt!&rdquo; She smiled with satisfaction:
she&rsquo;d write that fact to Cliff tonight....
&ldquo;But who,&rdquo; she asked herself, &ldquo;could be
paying Tom Adams a hundred dollars&mdash;and for
what? Surely not for the odd jobs he did for the
people of Shady Nook, or for Frazier at the
Royal Hotel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, she believed, she was on the right trail
in solving the mystery of the fires!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><i>Getting Business</i></h2>
<p>No one was at home when Mary Louise returned
from her visit to the store at Four Corners.
What a splendid chance it was to write to
Clifford Hunter to tell him about Tom Adams&rsquo;
card tricks! With this piece of evidence, a clever
lawyer ought to be able to clear Cliff of all suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Adams probably left that pack of cards
at the Smiths&rsquo; deliberately,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;I feel
almost positive now that he is the person who is
starting the fires. He had the <i>opportunity</i>; each
time one occurred, he was nowhere to be found.
I think he is doing it at somebody else&rsquo;s orders&mdash;for
a sum of money. But I can&rsquo;t find out who is
paying him, and I feel rather certain it isn&rsquo;t his
father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to watch Tom Adams like a hawk
for the next twenty-four hours, and as soon as I
can find out who is responsible, I&rsquo;ll wire the
police. But in the meantime, Cliff, I think you
ought to be freed, and I wish you and your lawyer
would come back to Shady Nook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She signed and sealed the letter and took it
immediately to the box at the entrance to Shady
Nook, where the rural postman collected mail
each day. Then, feeling that a fine piece of work
had been accomplished, she put away the groceries
and started the evening meal.</p>
<p>But Mary Louise made no mention of her suspicions
to the family that evening, nor did she say
anything about her letter to Cliff. She&rsquo;d tell Jane
later, when they were alone, for there was no
need of bringing up the subject of the fires again
in front of her mother. If Cliff did return, it
would be a pleasant surprise for Mrs. Gay&mdash;and
the other inhabitants of Shady Nook. Mary
Louise&rsquo;s only regret would be David McCall&rsquo;s
absence: she would love to have the pleasure of
saying, &ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; to that cocksure youth.</p>
<p>There was plenty to talk about at the supper
table that evening, without bringing up the mystery
of the fires. Jane had to tell all about the
new young men she had met and the fun they had
had over at the Reeds&rsquo;. She thought it was a
crime for Mary Louise to have missed it all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I had a caller,&rdquo; announced her chum.
&ldquo;In a different way, my afternoon was just as
thrilling as yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean David McCall, do you?&rdquo;
snapped Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no. He&rsquo;s gone home. No&mdash;not a man. A
girl. Adelaide Ditmar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adelaide Ditmar! What in the world did she
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;And you
must listen, too, Mother, for I want your advice.&rdquo;
And she proceeded to outline the proposition
which the young woman had made to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go into it,&rdquo; she concluded. &ldquo;I think
it means everything to Adelaide. Lots of people
have been poorer than the Ditmars at one time or
another, but I don&rsquo;t believe anybody has ever
been much more desperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why <i>we</i> have to give up our vacation
and work hard just because a married couple
can&rsquo;t get on!&rdquo; she objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise.
&ldquo;But it happens I want to. And I think Mabel
Reed will be keen to help&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t want
the job, Jane. So, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;ll run right
over there after supper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; laughed Jane.
&ldquo;Anybody that&rsquo;s ambitious has a right to work!
But you better wait a while, Mary Lou. The
Reeds may be over at the hotel, eating their dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Gay. &ldquo;Mrs.
Reed told me herself that they couldn&rsquo;t afford to
go over there oftener than once a week&mdash;with all
that family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind my doing it, Mother?&rdquo; inquired
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear&mdash;provided you don&rsquo;t get too tired.
But if you do, you can easily stop. Will you
promise me that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will, Mother,&rdquo; agreed the girl
as she started to gather up the dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; protested Jane. &ldquo;I may not be ambitious,
but I&rsquo;m not going to let you get the supper
and wash the dishes both. Freckles and I are
clearing up tonight. You run along, Mary Lou!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me!&rdquo; agreed her chum as she hurried
off to the Reeds&rsquo; cottage.</p>
<p>Mabel Reed listened to the proposition with
delight and immediately consented to help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go right around Shady Nook now,&rdquo; she
suggested, &ldquo;and get the people to sign up for the
meals. Then we&rsquo;ll have something definite to
take to Adelaide.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are a business woman, Mabel!&rdquo; exclaimed
Mary Louise admiringly. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;d
have to quote prices, wouldn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it the same as Flicks&rsquo; used to be&mdash;forty
cents for lunch and sixty for dinner. The Royal
charges a dollar for lunch and a dollar and a
half for dinner. So everybody would save a dollar
and a half a day by eating with us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frazier is going to hate us,&rdquo; remarked Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he is. But who cares?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll huff and he&rsquo;ll puff&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; muttered
Mary Louise, half to herself. &ldquo;Well, come on&mdash;let&rsquo;s
go. I&rsquo;ve got a pencil and paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always have a pencil and paper with
you,&rdquo; observed Mabel. &ldquo;Is that because you expect
to become a writer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll ever be a writer,
Mabel. I&rsquo;d rather <i>do</i> things than write about
them.&rdquo; She wished she might tell the other girl
what she had accomplished earlier in the summer
at Dark Cedars with the help of her notebook
and pencil, but that would seem too much
like bragging. Besides, the only way to succeed
in life is to forget about the past and keep looking
forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Write down seven Reeds and four Gays,&rdquo;
said Mabel. &ldquo;And two Ditmars. That makes
thirteen already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But four of those won&rsquo;t eat till the others are
served, so we&rsquo;ll need only nine chairs so far....
Now, let&rsquo;s see. Where shall we go first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go right up the line of the cottages.
Hunters&rsquo; is gone, of course, so we&rsquo;ll try the Partridges.
They have four in their family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Partridge is a great friend of mother&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
observed Mary Louise. &ldquo;I think they will
sign up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls walked a quarter of a mile up
the private road that wound along beside the
river, past the Hunters&rsquo; grounds, on to the pleasant
five-room cottage that belonged to the Partridges.
As there were no young people in this
family, Mary Louise did not know them so well,
but she felt sure that they would like the idea of
having their meals on this side of the river.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Partridge, and the two sisters
who spent the summer with them, were just coming
across the river in Mr. Frazier&rsquo;s launch
when the girls reached the scene. The hotelkeeper
himself was running the motorboat.</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled at them and waited until
the launch had puffed off before she explained
her plan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>Mrs. Partridge was delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;ll come&mdash;for our dinners,&rdquo; she
agreed immediately. &ldquo;My husband is going back
to the city, except for week-ends, and we three
women would just as soon have a bite of lunch
at home. But I hate this bothering with a boat
every night for dinner, although Mr. Frazier
has been most kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we can count on you three?&rdquo; asked
Mary Louise in delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and Mr. Partridge too on Saturdays
and Sundays,&rdquo; added the woman.</p>
<p>Mary Louise marked down the names, and the
two girls continued on their way, pleased with
their success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s three more paying guests,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;totaling twelve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s thrilling!&rdquo; exclaimed Mabel.</p>
<p>It was even more thrilling to find the Robinsons
just as enthusiastic about the plan, adding
four more names to their list.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; sighed Mabel. &ldquo;Unless we go
over to the Royal and try to get the Smiths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; returned Mary
Louise, &ldquo;because they&rsquo;d have nowhere to sleep.
And besides, they don&rsquo;t care about economy.
They have piles of money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;True. But I&rsquo;ll tell you whom we can get,
Mary Lou: those four Harrisburg boys. They
can put up tents in the woods and eat at Ditmars&rsquo;.
They&rsquo;ll love it, and besides, it will make
it possible for them to stay at Shady Nook a lot
longer. Their money will go so much farther
than it would at the Royal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is an idea, Mabel!&rdquo; cried Mary Louise.
&ldquo;And maybe they&rsquo;d be willing to eat at a second
table, so we shouldn&rsquo;t have to get extra chairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very thing. Sixteen chairs isn&rsquo;t so bad.
I guess the Ditmars have four, and we each have
a card-table set. I suppose the Robinson boys can
knock together a bench and some chairs for a
porch table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adelaide Ditmar suggested getting Tom
Adams to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d have to pay him! No, I think we
better ask the Robinson boys or Horace Ditmar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls reached the bungalow and found the
young couple waiting for them on the porch.
Horace Ditmar was a good-looking man of perhaps
twenty-five&mdash;not much older than David
McCall, Mary Louise thought&mdash;and Adelaide
was scarcely twenty. They were a handsome
pair: it was too bad if they weren&rsquo;t happy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Adelaide&rsquo;s eager blue eyes were gazing into
Mary Louise&rsquo;s as if she could not wait for her
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mabel and I have decided to help you, Adelaide,&rdquo;
announced Mary Louise immediately.
&ldquo;We just stopped at all the bungalows to find out
how many people we can get to promise to come
to the meals. We have sixteen for dinners and
thirteen for lunches&mdash;besides all of us who will
be working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen!&rdquo; repeated the young woman in delight.
&ldquo;Oh, Mary Lou, I knew everybody adored
you! If I&rsquo;d asked them myself they would all
have refused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, dear!&rdquo; remonstrated her husband, with
such an affectionate look at his wife that Mary
Louise was surprised. Maybe Horace Ditmar
was all right after all!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>The girls sat down on the porch and plunged
right into the discussion of all the details of carrying
out the plan. The young man was surprisingly
helpful and resourceful. As Adelaide had
said, he was keenly interested. He not only promised
to provide the needed tables and chairs, but
he drew plans for placing them and for arranging
the kitchen to utilize every bit of its space.
He knew how to make home-made ice cream,
he said, and he would drive over for all the supplies
twice a week. In fact, he took so much of
the work upon his own shoulders that the girls
felt as if there was little for them to do in advance.
They were to open for business the day
after tomorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all we have to do is borrow some silverware
and dishes,&rdquo; remarked Mabel as the girls
rose to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And engage Hattie Adams to wash them,&rdquo;
added Adelaide. &ldquo;But I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t go
home yet, girls. I was hoping we might play a
little bridge.&rdquo; Her tone was wistful. Mary
Louise knew how eager she was to make friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be over tomorrow,&rdquo; replied Mabel,
&ldquo;but I think we ought to go now, because those
Harrisburg boys are over at our bungalow, and
I want to see whether I can&rsquo;t get them to camp
over here in the woods and take their meals with
us. There are four of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl!&rdquo; approved Horace. &ldquo;Go right
after the business!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>So the girls said good-night and hurried off,
full of excitement over their new adventure. All
the young people who had gathered at the Reeds&rsquo;
were enthusiastic too: they were tired of dressing
up and going to the Royal Hotel, and enjoyed
the informal intimacy of a small boarding
house like Flicks&rsquo;. The four young men from
Harrisburg were only too glad to adopt Mabel&rsquo;s
suggestion, and planned to borrow the tents and
start camping out the same day that the dining
room was to open.</p>
<p>During the entire evening the mystery of the
fires was not mentioned. Indeed, nobody thought
of them until Jane and Mary Louise were alone
again, getting ready for bed. Then the former
referred to them casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you won&rsquo;t have time for solving any
more mysteries now, Mary Lou,&rdquo; she remarked,
&ldquo;with this dining room on your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; returned her companion,
&ldquo;that is just one reason why I wanted to go into
the thing. I was anxious to get to know Horace
Ditmar better. And I&rsquo;m practically convinced
that he had nothing to do with the fires!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who?&rdquo; inquired Jane. &ldquo;Rebecca
Adams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not Rebecca. But I did get a new clue
this afternoon, Jane. I learned something that
made me suspicious about her brother Tom!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Adams? Why, Mary Lou, I thought
you dismissed him long ago. When we learned
that the Adams family are losing jobs by these
fires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. But there&rsquo;s something we don&rsquo;t
understand yet. Anyhow, Tom Adams does card
tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Card tricks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He probably learned them from Cliff,
and maybe swiped his cards to do them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane&rsquo;s eyes opened wide with understanding.
&ldquo;That pack of cards at the Smith fire!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded. &ldquo;Exactly! That&rsquo;s just
what I&rsquo;ve been thinking. So I wrote to Cliff this
afternoon and told him about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane threw her arms around her friend and
hugged her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a wonder, Mary Lou!... But&mdash;but&mdash;can
you prove anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. But I mean to watch Tom Adams
and see whether I can&rsquo;t learn some more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he really is guilty and finds out that you
suspect him,&rdquo; observed Jane, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll take out his
spite by setting fire to this bungalow. You better
be careful, Mary Lou!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect to be,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking
for trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she hardly expected it in the form in
which it came the following day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><i>The Threat</i></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything I can do to help you people?&rdquo;
inquired Jane of Mary Louise the following
morning at the breakfast table. &ldquo;Pare potatoes&mdash;or
something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks, Jane,&rdquo; returned her chum.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting along fine. I would like to have
you pull a load of dishes over to the Ditmars&rsquo;
for me, Freckles,&rdquo; she added, turning to her
brother, &ldquo;in your wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., Sis,&rdquo; was the cheerful reply.</p>
<p>They left soon after breakfast, promising to
be back again in time for lunch. It was a beautiful
day, and Mary Louise was in high spirits,
anxious to get everything arranged for the opening
of the dining room the following morning.
Naturally, she expected Adelaide Ditmar to feel
the same way; she was therefore taken aback
when the young woman came to the door with a
distressed expression on her face and actual tears
in her eyes!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That husband of hers has done something,&rdquo;
Mary Louise thought resentfully. &ldquo;Oh, why
can&rsquo;t he behave himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Mary Lou,&rdquo; invited Adelaide, repressing
a sob. &ldquo;You too, Freckles, if you can
keep a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I can!&rdquo; replied the boy proudly.</p>
<p>They entered the charming little house, and
their hostess closed the door behind them. Then
she reached into the pocket of her apron and
took out a coarse piece of paper which she
handed to Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Mary Louise held the paper in front of her so
that her brother could see it at the same time.
The message was printed in pencil, and the
words were misspelled, but there could be no
mistaking its meaning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Clos up your place rite away, or expeck
FIRE!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mary Louise read it twice before she handed
it back to Adelaide Ditmar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did this come?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it under the back door,&rdquo; replied the
young woman in a hoarse whisper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t see anybody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early this morning. About half-past seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you show it to your husband?&rdquo; asked
Freckles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied Adelaide. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been so
nervous, you know, and this work has just been
wonderful for him. Oh, I can&rsquo;t bear to give it
up! It means more than money to us&mdash;it means
an occupation for Horace, saving him from melancholia,
perhaps. Mary Lou, what can we do?
Isn&rsquo;t there some policeman we can get to watch
our house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shady Nook never had one,&rdquo; replied the
other girl. &ldquo;I certainly do wish my Dad were
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father? What could he do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a detective,&rdquo; explained Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best detective in the world!&rdquo; added
Freckles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, where is he?&rdquo; sobbed Adelaide. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
we send for him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. He&rsquo;s out West somewhere, on
a case. No, I don&rsquo;t see what we can do except
watch. Never leave the house.&rdquo; She turned to
her brother. &ldquo;You boys scan the woods for suspects,
Freckles&mdash;and keep a hidden guard
around the cottage.... I&rsquo;m going to look for
Tom Adams&mdash;something made me suspicious of
him yesterday. Don&rsquo;t let him into the place, Adelaide....
And you&rsquo;ll have to tell Horace, because
he will need to be on guard too&mdash;especially
at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the work of a maniac, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said
Adelaide. &ldquo;Nobody else would want to burn
down all these cottages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it may be,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise.
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s Rebecca Adams who&rsquo;s
doing it. She&rsquo;s sick in bed.... Of course, she
might be up and around by this time&mdash;but I
don&rsquo;t think so. Anyway, I&rsquo;m going over there this
afternoon to engage Hattie for the job here, and
I&rsquo;ll make it a point to find out about Rebecca
then. In the meantime, let&rsquo;s get on with our
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adelaide dried her eyes, and Freckles rushed
off to round up his gang. Mary Louise settled
down to work; when Mabel Reed came over an
hour later, and Horace Ditmar returned in the
car with his purchase of supplies, they were both
amazed at the progress which had been made.
The little house had been transformed into a
tea room!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>With trembling hands Adelaide showed the
threatening message to her husband. She chose
a time when Mabel Reed was out of the room,
for Mary Louise had urged secrecy. No use
frightening people away from the dining room!</p>
<p>Horace Ditmar did not appear to be alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s just a practical joke on the part of
those Smith kids,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or maybe those Harrisburg
boys. The best thing we can do is ignore
it. I don&rsquo;t think we need to worry.&rdquo; And he
smiled so confidently that Mary Louise wondered
for a moment whether Horace Ditmar
could have set those other cottages on fire himself
and because of this fact feel perfectly safe
about his own?</p>
<p>But, no, that wasn&rsquo;t possible, she felt sure. She
had a new clue now: someone was objecting to
the serving of meals to Shady Nook people. The
same person who had destroyed Flicks&rsquo; Inn by
fire&mdash;the only person who could possibly resent
the project. It was Frazier, she thought, Frazier
who was guilty. The hotelkeeper could not bear
to lose his business, and he was bribing Tom
Adams to start the fires.... But how could
Mary Louise possibly prove this fact?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>However, she said nothing of her suspicions
to the Ditmars or to Freckles, but she warned
the boy not to mention the threat at home, for
fear of alarming her mother. So the Gay family
had a pleasant lunch that day, little thinking of
the danger that was lurking so terribly near.
They talked happily of the opening of the dining
room on the morrow and of their plans for
that afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all going to play tennis on the hotel
court after lunch,&rdquo; announced Jane. &ldquo;The boys
said they wanted to use it while they have the
chance, because they&rsquo;re going to put up their
tents over here tomorrow morning. And Frazier
will probably be so mad about losing them that
he&rsquo;ll refuse us all the use of the court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a court of our own,&rdquo; observed
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s not so good as the Royal&rsquo;s. Still,
it will do,&rdquo; agreed Jane. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;d
have time to play with us this afternoon, would
you, Mary Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied her chum. &ldquo;I have to
hunt up Hattie Adams&mdash;or we&rsquo;ll have to do all
the dish-washing ourselves tomorrow at the dining
room. I&rsquo;ll paddle across the river with you&mdash;she
may be working at the Royal Hotel. If
she isn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll have to come back and go see her
at the farm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly do like to work on a hot day,&rdquo;
yawned Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, it&rsquo;s not nearly such hot work as
tennis&mdash;with those strenuous boys,&rdquo; returned
Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you do go to Adams&rsquo; farm, be sure
to get back in time for a swim,&rdquo; urged Jane.</p>
<p>About an hour later the two girls put their
tennis rackets into the canoe and paddled across
the river. The tennis court was around behind
the hotel, away from the shore. Here they found
half a dozen young people, four of whom were
playing doubles.</p>
<p>The two extra boys on the bench moved over
and made room for Jane and Mary Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be through in a minute&mdash;the score&rsquo;s
five-two now,&rdquo; announced one of the young men.
&ldquo;Then we four will have a set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I had better play now,&rdquo; replied
Mary Louise, &ldquo;because I have to go hunt
up Hattie Adams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A girl we want to get to wash dishes at our
dining room. She may be working here now. Or
perhaps I can find her brother. Do you happen
to know Tom Adams? A fellow who does odd
jobs around the hotel sometimes?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>The boy nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know the guy you mean. Big brute
with light hair? I think he&rsquo;s back in the garage
now, fixing up Frazier&rsquo;s truck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise jumped to her feet: this was just
the information she wanted. She would rather
see Tom Adams than his sister, although she
didn&rsquo;t actually want to talk to him. Just to check
up on his movements!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be back in a few minutes!&rdquo; she called as she
disappeared through the clump of bushes behind
the tennis court.</p>
<p>In her sneakers she skipped along noiselessly,
unconscious of the fact that an outsider might
regard her actions as &ldquo;snooping.&rdquo; Yet when she
stopped just outside of the garage door because
she heard men&rsquo;s voices inside, she realized then
that she was really eavesdropping.</p>
<p>Immediately she identified the voices as belonging
to Mr. Frazier and Tom Adams. The
latter was evidently changing a tire on the truck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;ve got to have that money tonight!&rdquo;
snarled Tom Adams. &ldquo;I owe a guy a
hundred bucks, and I need the rest myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t pay it all now,&rdquo; whined Frazier. &ldquo;I
just haven&rsquo;t got it. I can let you have three hundred
and the rest when the job is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah? Well, the job ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; a be finished
till you cough up! All the dough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frazier&rsquo;s tone became more whining. &ldquo;Business
isn&rsquo;t any too good&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would it have been without me to
help?&rdquo; retorted the younger man. &ldquo;Did I&mdash;or
did I not put money in your pocket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure you did. And I&rsquo;m willing to pay
you for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment, while Mary
Louise waited breathlessly. She could not see the
men&rsquo;s faces, but she had no difficulty in following
their conversation. She heard the rattling of
paper money and knew that Frazier must be
paying Tom something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want a receipt?&rdquo; demanded Tom presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord, no!&rdquo; cried the other. &ldquo;Nothing
in writing, Tom. It might be used against us.
Guess I can trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to trust each other,&rdquo; sneered the
younger man. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I say you have no
right to hold out on me. I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; the dirty
work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Mary Louise felt that she had heard enough.
Everything was perfectly clear to her. The only
thing required was to wire the Albany police.
Forgetful of her own danger and her need for
secrecy until her discovery could be announced,
she ran across the front of the garage to the
kitchen door of the hotel. But not lightly
enough: both Frazier and Tom heard her and
stepped out of the garage to see who she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, Mary Louise?&rdquo; demanded
Frazier, wondering whether or not she
could have overheard their conversation. &ldquo;Lost
a tennis ball?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;looking for Hattie. Hattie
Adams.&rdquo; Her voice was trembling; she did her
best to make it sound unconcerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hattie doesn&rsquo;t work here,&rdquo; replied Mr.
Frazier. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t for a long time. What gave you
that idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought maybe she would, after she lost her
job with Flicks&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she doesn&rsquo;t. And I&rsquo;d thank you to keep
out of my kitchen and other places where you
don&rsquo;t belong, Miss Mary Louise Gay!&rdquo; returned
Frazier. Like all guilty people, he was angry at
the innocent, and he glared at the girl with hate
in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sorry, Mr. Frazier,&rdquo; replied Mary
Louise. Turning to Tom she asked, &ldquo;Is Hattie
over at the farm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon so,&rdquo; muttered the young man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Mary Louise turned about and went back to
the tennis court. Another set was in progress.
Jane was playing now, and Mary Louise did not
like to interrupt the game. So she merely picked
up her tennis racket and told the young people
on the bench that she was going home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to take the canoe,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I
guess some of you people can see that Jane gets
across the river in case I don&rsquo;t return in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.,&rdquo; agreed the boys.</p>
<p>Mary Louise walked rapidly toward the river,
trying to formulate a plan as she went. But it was
very difficult. Since there were no police at
Shady Nook, and the only telephone anywhere
near was at the Royal Hotel, she didn&rsquo;t know
how to proceed. There could be no doubt that
Frazier and Tom Adams were guilty of starting
the fires at Shady Nook, but what were the first
steps she should take in having them arrested?
Whom should she inform first? Oh, if her father
were only here to help her!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll burn the Ditmars&rsquo; down if I&rsquo;m not
quick,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;And they may do something
to me, because I think both men suspect
that I overheard that conversation. Oh, what
shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>She paddled across the river and tied the
canoe to the dock. Then she went inside the bungalow,
debating whether or not to take her
mother into her confidence.</p>
<p>But that question was answered for her. Mrs.
Gay was not at home, so there was no opportunity
to tell her.</p>
<p>Mary Louise sat down at the little desk in her
bedroom and took out her notebook. While the
conversation between the two men was fresh in
her mind she&rsquo;d write it down, to show to the
police when they arrived. Word for word, just
as Frazier and Tom Adams had spoken.</p>
<p>After she had finished that, she sat still for a
while, thinking. At last she decided upon a plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Adams first and make sure Hattie
will be over tomorrow,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Because
I mustn&rsquo;t let Adelaide down. Then I&rsquo;ll drive on
to the railroad station and wire the police in
Albany. Maybe I&rsquo;ll send Mrs. Hunter a telegram
too, so that she can help me out on the other
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced at her costume&mdash;a red-and-white
sports dress, which she usually wore for tennis
because of its short, full skirt. That would do,
although it was a little conspicuous&mdash;easy for
Tom Adams to identify in case he wanted to
know what she was doing. She&rsquo;d change her
shoes, however, for she liked pumps better than
sneakers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Ready at last, she went through the back door
of the bungalow to the garage. But here she met
with a disappointment she had not expected. The
car was not there!</p>
<p>Then she remembered. Her mother had promised
to take Mrs. Partridge and her sisters to a
country fair that afternoon and would be gone
until six o&rsquo;clock!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there&rsquo;s nothing for me to do but walk,&rdquo;
she concluded. &ldquo;Oh, if Cliff were only here so I
could borrow his!&rdquo; But if Cliff were here and
his house had not been burned, there would be
no necessity of sending that wire.</p>
<p>She started at once, cutting across a field and
walking as fast as she could, in spite of the heat,
for it was almost four o&rsquo;clock now, and she and
Jane had promised her mother that they would
prepare the supper. But Jane was a good scout,
Mary Louise thought; she&rsquo;d go ahead just the
same if she were alone, so that part needn&rsquo;t
worry her. The important thing was to get that
telegram to Albany before anything disastrous
happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>Yet her fears were entirely for the Ditmars as
she trudged up the long hill to the Adams farm.
Never once was she afraid for her own sake&mdash;not
until her own horrible fate descended upon
her with the suddenness of a clap of thunder.
Then, and then only did she realize what a risk
she had taken by coming to this lonely place by
herself. Away from her friends, her family&mdash;everybody&mdash;alone,
with a cruel enemy and a
crazy woman!</p>
<p>For Mary Louise Gay was forcibly prevented
from going to the station that afternoon to send
the wire to the police in Albany!</p>

<br /><i>The Search</i></h2>
<p>Jane Patterson finished her tennis match and
came back across the river in a canoe belonging
to one of the boys, just as Mary Louise had suggested.
Although she had hoped that her chum
would return in time for the afternoon swim,
she was not surprised when Mary Louise failed
to appear. Adams&rsquo; farm was farther off than you
thought&mdash;when you had to go the whole distance
on foot. Jane remembered that Mrs. Gay had
taken the car to the fair.</p>
<p>She managed to find Freckles in the water and
asked him to come right back to the bungalow
after the swim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Lou has gone to Adams&rsquo; farm to see
Hattie,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;She had to walk, so
she&rsquo;ll be all in when she gets back. Your mother
will be tired too. So let&rsquo;s have supper ready,
Freckles. You can set the table and crack the ice
for the tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K., Jane,&rdquo; agreed the boy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with
you as soon as I can dress.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>The two young people worked fast: at six
o&rsquo;clock, when Mrs. Gay drove back from the
fair, they had the meal on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly smells good, girls!&rdquo; she exclaimed
as she came through the kitchen door
from the garage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls nothing!&rdquo; retorted Freckles. &ldquo;You
mean &lsquo;girl and boy,&rsquo; Mother. I did a lot of work
for this meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, dear,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Gay. &ldquo;But
where&rsquo;s Mary Lou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went over to Adams&rsquo; farm to see Hattie,&rdquo;
answered Jane. &ldquo;And she hasn&rsquo;t come back
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all this heat? Oh, that&rsquo;s too bad! She
should have waited till I got home with the car.
I didn&rsquo;t know she was going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t sure of it herself. She was hoping
to find Hattie over at the hotel. But evidently she
didn&rsquo;t, for she didn&rsquo;t wait to play any tennis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess she&rsquo;ll be along soon,&rdquo; remarked
Mrs. Gay cheerfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep a plate hot for
her. But let&rsquo;s eat. We&rsquo;re all hungry, and this food
is too good to spoil by drying up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>The meal passed off pleasantly; nobody
thought of being worried by Mary Louise&rsquo;s absence.
But as the minutes went by and she did
not come, Freckles was the first to become anxious.
For he remembered the threat to the Ditmars
on that coarse piece of paper that morning,
and he knew that Mary Louise was involved in
that same business.</p>
<p>When seven o&rsquo;clock struck and still his sister
had not put in an appearance, he suggested that
his mother take the car and drive over to
Adams&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a lonely road up to that farm,&rdquo; he
explained, &ldquo;that if Mary Lou had sprained her
ankle or hurt herself on the way, nobody might
pass by for hours to give her help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay was startled. It had not occurred to
her that anything might have happened to her
daughter. Mary Louise was always so self-reliant,
and Shady Nook was such a safe place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two people go,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here
and wash the dishes. I want to squeeze some
lemons, because some of the bunch are coming
over here tonight&mdash;if that&rsquo;s all right with you,
Mrs. Gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly it&rsquo;s all right, dear. And Mary Lou
will be delighted, too&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Mrs. Gay backed the car out of the garage
with Freckles in the seat beside her and drove
slowly up the dirt road which led to Adams&rsquo;
farm. The boy kept a sharp watch on both sides
of the road, to make sure that his sister was not
lying helpless along the way. Twice his mother
stopped the car; and they both called Mary
Louise&rsquo;s name. But there was no response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may just have stayed for supper with
Hattie,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Gay. &ldquo;And of course,
since neither of us has a telephone, she couldn&rsquo;t
let us know. She&rsquo;d think we wouldn&rsquo;t worry so
long as she got home before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure,&rdquo; muttered the boy. But he was anxious:
his mother didn&rsquo;t know what had happened
that morning.</p>
<p>They reached the Adams&rsquo; gate at last and got
out of the car. Old Mr. Adams was sitting alone
on the porch with one leg propped up on a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, Mr. Adams,&rdquo; began Mrs.
Gay. &ldquo;Is Mary Louise here? I&rsquo;m her mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the old man, taking
the pipe out of his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as I know of. Hattie and I have been to
the fair all afternoon. If your daughter was here,
she must have turned right around and gone
home again. Nobody was home all afternoon except
poor Rebecca. And she&rsquo;s sick abed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>A feeling of alarm crept over Mrs. Gay.
What could have happened to Mary Louise?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Tom home?&rdquo; demanded Freckles, remembering
his sister&rsquo;s warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t reckon so. He was workin&rsquo; over to the
hotel today, after he helped our hired man this
mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he here now? Could we ask him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom packed up and left tonight, right after
supper. Hattie drove him down to the Junction
to catch the train. He&rsquo;s got a friend out West
somewhere who owns a ranch. So Tom decided
all of a sudden to go there. I tried to stop him,
for we need him here, as I&rsquo;m all crippled up
with rheumatism half the time. But he wouldn&rsquo;t
listen to me. Pig-headed, that&rsquo;s what I call it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freckles&rsquo; eyes opened wide with terror. It
sounded as if Mary Louise had been right in assuming
Tom&rsquo;s guilt in connection with the fires
at Shady Nook. Running away proved it! But
what had he done to Mary Lou first?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could we talk to Rebecca?&rdquo; inquired Mrs.
Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Adams. &ldquo;But it probably
won&rsquo;t do no good. She can&rsquo;t remember things
straight, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She might remember seeing Mary Louise, if
she had stopped in,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Gay. &ldquo;Anyhow,
it&rsquo;s worth trying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go right up,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Room at
the back of the house. You won&rsquo;t have no trouble
finding it. Sorry I can&rsquo;t go with you, but my
leg&rsquo;s pretty bad tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; responded Mrs. Gay.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find the way by myself. You better stay
here, Freckles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked disappointed; he would have
liked to take another look at that queer creature
and size her up for himself. Maybe she had done
something to Mary Lou! But he sat down on the
steps as his mother advised and waited patiently.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay hurried on up to Rebecca&rsquo;s room,
and found the woman in bed, as she had expected,
with her tangled gray hair spread over
the pillows. She stared blankly at her visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mary Louise&rsquo;s mother, Rebecca,&rdquo; announced
Mrs. Gay. &ldquo;You remember Mary
Louise? The girl who saved the Smith baby in
the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I know Mary
Louise. She came to see me today. Got me a
drink of water. It wasn&rsquo;t well water, but it tasted
good. She is a fine girl. I like Mary Louise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What time was she here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t tell time. It&rsquo;s all the
same to me&mdash;except day and night. She was here
in daytime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was she going after she left you?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;Did she happen to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t.... I heard a car outside&mdash;I
think it was my brother Tom&rsquo;s. But I don&rsquo;t
know if Mary Louise had gone before that or
not. I can&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo; Her voice trailed off as
if she were half dreaming. &ldquo;She said she&rsquo;d look
for well water for me, because I&rsquo;m sick. She said
she&rsquo;d come again. Oh, Mary Louise is a good
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay walked to the doorway. There was
nothing more to be learned from Rebecca. She
wasn&rsquo;t even sure that the woman knew what she
was talking about.</p>
<p>If only she could talk to the brother! But it
was too late now; the only thing to do was to
wait for Hattie to return from the Junction and
see whether she had any news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rebecca says that Mary Louise was here this
afternoon,&rdquo; she told Mr. Adams and Freckles
when she returned to the porch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that don&rsquo;t mean nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; remarked
the old man. &ldquo;Like as not, Rebecca&rsquo;s confusing
today with yesterday or even last week.
She ain&rsquo;t got no memory at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Hattie will be back soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon so. Sounds like the Ford now, at the
bottom of the hill. But she was away all afternoon,
you recollect, at the fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Gay. &ldquo;But Rebecca
seems to remember a car arriving about the time
Mary Louise left, and she thought it was your
son&rsquo;s. So maybe he saw Mary Louise and mentioned
it to Hattie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freckles&rsquo; heart stood still at these words. Tom
Adams, with a car! What had he done to Mary
Lou?</p>
<p>But he did not say anything; he waited for
Hattie Adams to drive her car into the garage.</p>
<p>In another moment the girl appeared on the
porch and nodded pleasantly to Mrs. Gay and
Freckles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mary Lou?&rdquo; she inquired immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what we want to know!&rdquo; cried
Freckles. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s&mdash;lost! Did Tom say anything
about seeing her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t. He never mentioned her.
Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Mrs. Gay explained again what Rebecca had
said, but Hattie was just as doubtful as her
father had been about the veracity of any of Rebecca&rsquo;s
statements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go by that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But Mary
Lou may be home by this time, waiting for you.
Don&rsquo;t worry till you find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sounded like good advice, so Mrs. Gay
and Freckles got into their car and drove as
quickly as possible back to Shady Nook. Jane,
the Reed twins, Stuart Robinson, and the four
new boys were all waiting anxiously on the Gays&rsquo;
porch. But Mrs. Gay knew immediately from
their expressions that Mary Louise had not returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the boys together at once, Freckles,&rdquo;
commanded Stuart Robinson, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll search
the woods thoroughly. Two of you fellows paddle
across to the island, and two more go over to
the hotel and hunt around there. Mary Lou may
have sprained her ankle somewhere and be waiting
for help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay went inside the cottage, into her
bedroom, and sat down, making a desperate effort
to control her fears. But she couldn&rsquo;t help
thinking of all the dreadful stories she had read
in the newspapers&mdash;stories of kidnaping and
sudden death. Oh, if only her husband were here!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>She picked up his last letter from the bureau.
He was in Cleveland now and hoped to be with
them soon. Soon! She must have him immediately.
She remembered the promise she had
given him when they said good-bye&mdash;to send for
him if she needed him. Yes, she would wire tonight!
She&rsquo;d paddle across the river to the hotel
and send a telegram over the phone.</p>
<p>Coming out of the door again she almost ran
into Horace Ditmar, with Freckles beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re afraid this is serious, Mrs. Gay,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Freckles said Mary Louise suspected Tom
Adams of starting the fires at Shady Nook and
writing us a threat, which we found under our
door this morning. And now your boy tells me
that Tom Adams has run away.... So we&rsquo;re
afraid that he may have done something to Mary
Louise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Gay, aghast. &ldquo;Oh, it just
isn&rsquo;t possible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is, Mother,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;And Mr.
Ditmar thinks we should send for the police immediately.
He&rsquo;ll go over to the hotel and send a
wire now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Mrs. Gay sank unsteadily into a chair. For an
instant she thought she was going to faint. But
she made a desperate effort to control herself;
she realized that she needed all her powers in
this terrible emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, go, Mr. Ditmar,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And telegraph
to my husband at the same time.&rdquo; She
scribbled a message on the envelope with Mr.
Gay&rsquo;s address and handed it to the young man.</p>
<p>Mr. Ditmar left immediately, and Freckles
brought his mother a glass of water. She drank
it gratefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Mrs. Reed,&rdquo; he announced
cheerfully. &ldquo;Have her stay with you while I join
the boys, Mother,&rdquo; he said, bending down and
kissing her. &ldquo;For I can&rsquo;t leave you alone.&rdquo; In
these last two hours the boy had suddenly seemed
to grow up. His mother realized the fact, and, in
spite of her trouble, she was grateful and proud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all right, dear,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;And you
go along. Mary Lou knows your whistle better
than anything else, and if she is somewhere in
the woods, you&rsquo;ll surely find her.... Go,
dear!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Freckles ran off, and a systematic search of all
the country around Shady Nook began: with
lanterns and flashlights and whistles, interspersed
by frequent calls from the boys and girls.
But as the darkness grew deeper and the silence
of the woods more intense, an increasing sense of
alarm took hold of all the searchers. Joking and
laughter ceased; the only singing that broke out
was forced, because someone thought it might
help find Mary Louise. But it was all in vain.</p>
<p>Midnight came, and the various groups made
their way back to Shady Nook, tired, hungry,
and disheartened. Mrs. Gay and Mr. and Mrs.
Reed and the three Partridge women were all
still sitting on the Gays&rsquo; porch, hopefully waiting
for news. But they knew from the slow, silent
manner of the young people&rsquo;s return that
they had not been successful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make us some coffee, and we&rsquo;ll begin all over
again,&rdquo; said Stuart Robinson. &ldquo;Mary Lou must
be somewhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think you better all go to bed. The children
must have their sleep. In the morning the
police will come. Perhaps they will have some
news for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we hadn&rsquo;t let Tom Adams get away
from us!&rdquo; muttered Horace Ditmar. &ldquo;We went
back to Adams&rsquo; and got the old man out of bed
to try to learn Tom&rsquo;s address. But he said he
didn&rsquo;t know it, and I&rsquo;m inclined to believe he
was speaking the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Even in her half-frenzied state, Mrs. Gay
looked at the young architect and thought what
an admirable man he was. How anyone could
have thought him guilty of any crime was more
than she could understand. He was more help to
her in the crisis than anyone else&mdash;except
Freckles.</p>
<p>So, accepting Mrs. Gay&rsquo;s advice, the group
dispersed to their own cottages, intending to continue
the search the following morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br /><i>Captive</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise was not far away from Shady
Nook in the matter of miles, but she felt as if she
were worlds away. Everything was strangely different
from anything she had ever known&mdash;grotesque
and terrible. For the place she was taken
to was an asylum for the insane!</p>
<p>Little did she think as she entered the Adams&rsquo;
farmhouse that afternoon that her freedom was
to be snatched from her. That she was to be held
in hopeless captivity, without any means of communication
with the outside world. A prisoner
in a house that was far worse than a jail, enduring
a life that was living death!</p>
<p>When no one answered her knock at the
Adams&rsquo; door that afternoon, she opened the
screen and walked in, calling first Hattie and
then Rebecca by name. Finally the latter replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m up here, sick abed!&rdquo; called the woman.
&ldquo;Who be you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mary Louise,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;May I
come up and see you, Rebecca?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. Come! Have you found a well of
clear water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise laughed to herself as she ran up
the stairs. She wished that she could find some
well water for the poor deluded woman, but
there was none in the vicinity. She wondered
what Rebecca would do if she ever did discover
a well.</p>
<p>She entered the bedroom, smiling and shaking
her head at the poor eager creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Rebecca&mdash;not yet. But I&rsquo;ll find you one
some day. How are you feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m better. I want to get out soon. Will you
get me a drink of water, Mary Louise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;From the kitchen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. From the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman sank back on her pillow, and
Mary Louise went for the water. When she returned,
Rebecca was half asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your water, Rebecca,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But
where is Hattie?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Gone away, I guess. They&rsquo;ve all
gone away.... Soon I&rsquo;ll go too....&rdquo; Her
voice trailed off as if she were half dreaming,
and Mary Louise walked to the door. She heard
the sound of a car in the driveway below, and
hoping that it might be Hattie, she went down
the stairs.</p>
<p>But the car standing in front of the house was
not the dilapidated Ford that belonged to the
Adams family. It was a big black limousine
which reminded Mary Louise of a hearse or a
funeral carriage, and she shuddered. It might
have been an ambulance, but ambulances were
usually white. She wondered what a car like that
could be doing at the Adams farm.</p>
<p>Two men got down from the driver&rsquo;s seat in
front, and Tom Adams came and joined them at
the porch steps. They talked in low tones to each
other. Mary Louise opened the screen door and
came out on the porch. Suddenly she heard her
own name mentioned, and a cold chill of horror
crept up her spine. What were they planning to
do to her?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says she&rsquo;s Mary Louise Gay,&rdquo; remarked
Tom. &ldquo;Insists on it. And she does look like a girl
by that name. But don&rsquo;t believe her. She&rsquo;s my
sister Rebecca.&rdquo; He raised his eyes and looked
straight at Mary Louise. &ldquo;Hello, Rebecca!&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to take you for a ride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s brown eyes flashed in anger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rebecca&rsquo;s upstairs, sick in bed,&rdquo; she retorted.
&ldquo;Go and see for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, with the agility of panthers, the two
men sprang forward and grabbed Mary Louise&rsquo;s
wrists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Rebecca,&rdquo; one of them said.
&ldquo;No use struggling. We&rsquo;re taking you to a nice
farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a desperate effort to free herself from
the men&rsquo;s grasp, Mary Louise kicked one of her
captors in the leg. He let go of her hand, but the
other man held her tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wild little beast,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Now, sister,
you take it easy. We ain&rsquo;t going to hurt you.
You&rsquo;ll like it where you&rsquo;re going&mdash;you&rsquo;ll get
better care than you do here. Your brother says
there&rsquo;s nobody here to look after you now that
your mother&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not my brother!&rdquo; shouted Mary Louise.
&ldquo;And I can prove it! Just drive down to Shady
Nook&mdash;a couple of miles&mdash;and ask anybody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the men preferred to ignore this challenge;
they picked Mary Louise up bodily and
thrust her into the back of the limousine, shutting
the door and turning the key in the lock!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>She found herself sitting on a long seat that
ran the length of the car. There were no windows
on the side; only two tiny oval glasses in
the back door permitted a little light to enter the
enclosure. Before she could utter another sound
she heard the engine start, and the vehicle went
into motion. Over the rough, stony driveway,
onto the dirt road that led away from the farm,
in the opposite direction from Shady Nook.</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s first impulse was to scream as
loudly as she could in the hope of attracting the
notice of the occupants of some passing car or of
some farmer working in his field. But second
consideration told her that such a proceeding
would do her no good at all. As soon as those
men in the front seat explained that she was a
crazy person being taken to an insane asylum,
nobody would believe anything she said.</p>
<p>The realization of this fact brought a deathly
hopelessness to her whole body. Her arms and
legs felt inert, her head sank back against the
cushion as if her very spirit were flowing away.
Leaving her helpless&mdash;and finished with life.</p>
<p>For perhaps ten minutes she sat thus, unmindful
of the country through which she was being
driven. As if she had been stunned by a physical
blow and no aid were near.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Then suddenly she thought of Tom Adams,
and a fierce anger took possession of her, reviving
her spirits, bringing her back to life. She
would not give up! She would fight to the bitter
end; she&rsquo;d make him pay&mdash;and pay heavily&mdash;for
his diabolical cruelty!</p>
<p>She moved along the seat to the far end of the
car and peered through the tiny window. The
road over which they were passing was narrow
and rough; the country unfamiliar. It was not a
main highway, Mary Louise instantly concluded,
and she wondered in which direction it
lay from Shady Nook. She wished now that she
had watched it from the beginning. She did not
even know whether they had crossed the river or
not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, I suppose that doesn&rsquo;t really matter,&rdquo;
she thought. &ldquo;Because, if I can manage to get
away at all, I can easily find my family. They&rsquo;ll
be hunting for me.&rdquo; Tears of distress came to her
eyes as she pictured her mother&rsquo;s anguish. And
her father was so far away!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did I ever try to be a detective?&rdquo; she
groaned. &ldquo;The punishment is too horrible.
Mother and Daddy would rather lose their cottage
and have the whole settlement at Shady
Nook burned than have me endure torture like
this!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>On and on they went through the lonely, unpopulated
country. Time seemed to stand still;
it was as if the afternoon were to last forever.
Yet when Mary Louise glanced at her wristwatch
she saw that it was not yet five o&rsquo;clock!</p>
<p>They crossed over a little stream, and the car
turned at an angle and climbed a hill. Up, up
they went, until they reached a narrow road at
the summit. Looking down into the valley below
Mary Louise could see a stream&mdash;not as
wide as the river&mdash;winding its peaceful way in
the summer sunshine. It was a beautiful spot&mdash;if
you could enjoy beauty. But it meant nothing at
all to the unhappy girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks like a main road across the valley
on the opposite side of the stream,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;If I can escape, I&rsquo;ll make for that.
Thank goodness I know how to swim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wished that she had thought to glance at
her watch when the car started, so that she could
roughly judge the distance from Shady Nook by
the time it took to cover it. But she had been so
miserable that she could not tell whether she had
been riding twenty minutes or a couple of hours.</p>
<p>At last, however, the car came to a stop at a
high iron gate which reminded Mary Louise of
a penitentiary. So this was the way they guarded
feeble-minded people!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>One of the men got down from his seat, took
a key from his pocket to unlock the gate, and
swung the heavy iron doors open. When the car
had gone through he locked them securely behind
him.</p>
<p>A shiver of horror passed over Mary Louise
as she heard that final click. A sense of hopelessness
overpowered her to such an intense degree
that she felt physically sick. A life of utter emptiness
was closing her in, as if her mind and her
soul had been extracted from her body. How
much more fiendish her existence would be than
that of any ordinary victim of kidnapers! But
then, Tom Adams had not kidnaped her because
he wanted a ransom, but only because he desired
to get rid of her. Well, he had succeeded! Nobody
in the whole world would think of looking
for her in an insane asylum.</p>
<p>The car wound around a lovely driveway,
shaded by trees, and stopped in front of a long,
low plaster building that appeared to be at least
a hundred years old. A man and a woman came
out of the ivy-covered door as the driver unlocked
the back of the limousine.</p>
<p>With her head held high in defiance, Mary
Louise stepped out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Rebecca,&rdquo; greeted the
woman, a plain-faced person of about fifty, in a
gray dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been a ghastly mistake!&rdquo; announced
Mary Louise, trying to keep her tone dignified.
&ldquo;Tom Adams is a criminal, and because I found
him out he has sent me here, calling me his
feeble-minded sister. I am not Rebecca Adams&mdash;but
Mary Louise Gay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man and the woman exchanged significant
glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Adams warned us that you would say
that,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;He said you do look like
a girl named Mary Louise Gay. But try to forget
it, Rebecca. We have your papers, signed by
your own brother and your cousin, so there is
nothing you can do about it but submit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin!&rdquo; repeated Mary Louise, thinking
of her aunt&rsquo;s children, aged nine and six.
How could they commit anybody to an insane
asylum?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Stanfield Frazier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frazier!&rdquo; she cried in scorn. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not my
cousin! He&rsquo;s no relation. He&rsquo;s a crook too, like
Tom Adams.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, Rebecca, calm yourself,&rdquo; advised
the woman, taking Mary Louise&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;And
just come along with me. You don&rsquo;t want to make
trouble! Wouldn&rsquo;t you rather walk by yourself
than have these men carry you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears of anguish came to the girl&rsquo;s eyes; she
looked desperately about at the group of people
who were surrounding her, searching for some
spark of sympathy or understanding. But the
men were all regarding her with an amused expression
of tolerance, as if her action were just
what they had expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there some way I can prove that I&rsquo;m
sane?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Some test I can take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t get yourself all worked up, Rebecca,&rdquo;
answered the woman. &ldquo;Your brother told
us you were all right most of the time and that
you probably wouldn&rsquo;t give us any trouble.
We&rsquo;re not going to put you into chains. You&rsquo;ll
like it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise groaned. There was nothing she
could do or say so long as they believed that
wicked Tom Adams.</p>
<p>So she meekly followed the woman into the
house. Its large hall and big reception room were
plain and old-fashioned, with very little furniture
in them, but she noticed that everything
was scrupulously neat and clean. For that much
she was thankful. Often, she had read, the places
where kidnapers confined their victims were
filthy and germ laden. She need have no fear of
disease here&mdash;except disease of the mind!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>A younger woman in the white uniform of a
nurse came into the hall to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Miss Stone, Rebecca,&rdquo; announced the
older woman. &ldquo;She will help you and take care
of you. Now go with Miss Stone to your room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you bring any bag, Rebecca?&rdquo; asked
the nurse, as she led Mary Louise up a flight of
stairs to a long corridor.</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kidnapers don&rsquo;t usually allow their victims
time to pack their suitcases,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And if
you don&rsquo;t mind, Miss Stone, will you call me by
my right name? It&rsquo;s Mary Louise Gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young woman nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Mary Louise,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>Mary Louise looked at the nurse hopefully,
wondering whether she was really finding a
friend. Did the nurse believe her?</p>
<p>All the doors along the corridor were closed,
but Mary Louise had no way of telling whether
they were locked or not until, down near the
end, she suddenly heard a loud pounding. Miss
Stone stopped and, taking a key from her chain,
unlocked the door. A mild-faced woman of
about thirty-five came out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to see who was coming,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Ah! A pretty girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Stone paused and introduced them courteously.
The patient was dressed in the blue
calico of the institution, but there was nothing
queer or odd about her looks. She appeared to
be much more normal than Rebecca Adams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mary Louise Gay,&rdquo; said Miss Stone.
&ldquo;She has come to live with us. And this, Mary
Louise, is Joan of Arc. The girl who saved
France, you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Mary Louise, in amazement.
Was Miss Stone joking, or did the patient really
believe she was Joan of Arc?</p>
<p>The woman in calico smiled proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I rode right at the head of
my soldiers. I told them God was on our side.
And we won! But they are going to burn me at
the stake for being a witch if they ever find me.
That&rsquo;s why I stay here. I&rsquo;m safe here. Aren&rsquo;t I,
Miss Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, you&rsquo;re safe,&rdquo; was the nurse&rsquo;s gentle
assurance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>A lump came into Mary Louise&rsquo;s throat. The
pathos of it all! Yet how kind and sweet Miss
Stone was. Oh, but&mdash;ghastly thought&mdash;the nurse
was being kind to Mary Louise in the same way!
That was why she humored her by calling her
&ldquo;Mary Louise.&rdquo; And all the time she believed
her to be Rebecca Adams!</p>
<p>Three doors farther down the nurse stopped
and unlocked another door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is to be your room, Mary Louise,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be nicer when you put some flowers
in it. We have a lovely garden, and most of the
patients have their own special flower beds. You
can grow whatever you like best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise looked about her. Never in her
life had she seen such a plain room. It contained
only a bed and a washstand and one chair. Not
even a bureau or a table! The window was high
and uncurtained. To her horror Mary Louise
saw that it was protected by iron bars!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take off your clothing now and have a
bath. You can put your own things in the drawer
of that washstand, and I&rsquo;ll bring you fresh clothing.
Everybody wears blue here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do I take my bath?&rdquo; asked Mary
Louise dully. Not that she cared in the least, except
that it would be something to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to the showers when I come back
with your new clothing,&rdquo; replied Miss Stone.
And to Mary Louise&rsquo;s dismay the nurse locked
the door from the outside as she departed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>The next twelve hours seemed to Mary Louise
the longest she had ever lived through. After her
bath she was told to lie down until supper time.
She was entirely alone in that bare room until
six o&rsquo;clock, with nothing to do but think. Finally
an attendant brought her a tray of food, well
cooked and wholesome but far from dainty.
Nevertheless, Mary Louise ate it, for she knew
that she must keep up her strength if she ever
hoped to make an escape. Another attendant removed
the tray, and she was left alone again
until eight o&rsquo;clock. Then Miss Stone returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a little vesper service in the reception
room, Mary Louise,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Would you
like to come and join us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl jumped up eagerly. Anything would
be better than this dreadful idleness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t your patients have anything to do?&rdquo;
she inquired as she went down the hall with the
nurse. &ldquo;This doing nothing is enough to drive
anybody crazy!&rdquo; She smiled to herself at the use
of the common expression and wondered
whether Miss Stone noticed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>But the nurse gave no sign of any amusement.
&ldquo;Oh, yes, Mary Louise,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;there will
be lots for you to do tomorrow. Everybody takes
some share in the work, if possible. Unless they
are too ill. And we go for walks around the
grounds and work in the garden. But we thought
you&rsquo;d be too tired tonight and would just want
to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They joined a group of perhaps twenty people
in the reception room for the singing of
hymns, and the same woman who had met Mary
Louise at the door of the building read the
Bible. Mary Louise looked about curiously at
her fellow inmates and did not find them particularly
strange-looking. One or two of them
had queer, staring eyes like Rebecca Adams, but
for the most part they appeared normal. Which
fact made it all the harder for Mary Louise to
prove anything about herself to the caretakers!</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock the service was over and
everybody went to bed. But, exhausted as she
was, Mary Louise could not go to sleep. She
tried over and over to formulate some plan of
escape, but with the locked doors, the constant
supervision of nurses and attendants, and that
high stone wall, it seemed absolutely hopeless.</p>
<p>It was only when the first gray light of dawn
broke in the sky that she finally dozed off and
then fell into a deep, heavy sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><i>Weary Waiting</i></h2>
<p>Like her daughter, Mrs. Gay did not go to
sleep until dawn of the following morning. Her
mental torture was even keener than Mary
Louise&rsquo;s, for her imagination suggested all sorts
of horrible fates, worse than the one the girl was
actually enduring. Physical violence, association
with hardened criminals, hunger, thirst&mdash;and&mdash;death.
That was the most terrifying thought of
all&mdash;the fear that Mary Louise might already be
dead!</p>
<p>Like her daughter&rsquo;s, too, Mrs. Gay&rsquo;s suffering
was all the more intense because she had to bear
it alone through the long, silent night. Freckles
and Jane, tired out from their vigorous search,
had fallen instantly asleep. There was nobody
to sympathize with the poor frenzied mother.
She swallowed dose after dose of aspirin, until
finally, with the first gray streaks of dawn, she
at last fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Freckles was the first person awake in the
household the next morning, and he immediately
started the breakfast. Jane, arriving on the scene
fifteen minutes later, was surprised and delighted
at the boy&rsquo;s progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We better not waken Mother,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t suppose she got much sleep last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&rdquo; Tears came to Jane&rsquo;s eyes as
they rested on the forlorn little dog sitting so
disconsolately in the corner of the kitchen.
&ldquo;Freckles, what do you think could have happened
to Mary Lou?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Tom Adams did something to her.
Kidnaped her, probably. But I had one idea this
morning, Jane, while I was making the coffee.
Maybe he hid her in his own house somewhere!
We never thought to search that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bright boy!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane, so loudly as to
awaken Mrs. Gay, who heard her from her bedroom.
For one ecstatic moment the woman
hoped that her daughter had been found. But
Freckles&rsquo; next remark dispelled any such idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth looking into,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;But
I don&rsquo;t really think she&rsquo;s there, or Hattie would
come and tell us. I can&rsquo;t believe Hattie is an
enemy&mdash;or on Tom&rsquo;s side. She&rsquo;s too fond of
Mary Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Mrs. Gay, attired in a kimono and looking
white and exhausted, peered in at the kitchen
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That coffee smells so good,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that
I just can&rsquo;t wait for a cup of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freckles grinned in delight and poured out
the steaming liquid. It seemed to revive his
mother, and she drank it eagerly. But she could
not eat any breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going up to Adams&rsquo; first,&rdquo; announced
the boy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get Stu Robinson to drive us in his
car&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll take Silky along. If Mary Lou
should be hidden there, Silky&rsquo;d find her....
And, Mother&mdash;if the police come, be sure to
have them talk to Horace Ditmar and get a look
at that threat he found shoved under his door
yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, dear,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Gay, smiling to
herself at the idea of taking orders from her
small son. But the boy was proving himself both
practical and businesslike in the management of
the whole affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether Adelaide Ditmar will
open her dining room today as she planned,&rdquo; remarked
Jane.</p>
<p>A lump came into Mrs. Gay&rsquo;s throat, but she
managed to reply calmly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. She has all her food bought, and
besides, the people are expecting it. Mrs. Reed
told me last night that Sue and Mabel are both
going to help her&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;Mary Lou doesn&rsquo;t
come back in time. You had better tell Hattie
Adams to come down to the Ditmars&rsquo; as soon as
she can, though I don&rsquo;t believe Adelaide is planning
to serve lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane nodded, and finished her breakfast. After
she and Freckles and the little dog had gone, the
people from the other bungalows began to arrive
at the Gays&rsquo;, to start upon a new search for the
missing girl. Horace Ditmar sent them off in
various directions while he and several of the
older women stayed behind to help and to advise
Mrs. Gay.</p>
<p>At nine-thirty a small red car drove into
Shady Nook and stopped at the Gays&rsquo; bungalow.
Three plainclothes men got out, displaying their
badges for identification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want the whole story,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;So far
we know nothing&mdash;except that Mary Louise
Gay, of Riverside and Shady Nook, is missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know much more ourselves,&rdquo; sighed
Mrs. Gay. Then she proceeded to tell the story
of the girl&rsquo;s disappearance the preceding afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As far as we know, the last person who saw
her alive is Rebecca Adams, a feeble-minded
woman who lives over at a farm where we know
that Mary Louise started to go. Nobody saw her
after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any suspicions at all?&rdquo; inquired
the detective.</p>
<p>Horace Ditmar answered that question by telling
about the three fires at Shady Nook and by
showing the paper which had warned him of the
possibility of a fourth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Louise suspected Tom Adams&mdash;the
brother of this feeble-minded woman&mdash;though
we don&rsquo;t know yet upon what clues she based her
suspicions,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;But it looks as if
Adams was guilty, for he ran away. He didn&rsquo;t
take Mary Louise with him&mdash;we know that, because
his sister drove him to the Junction&mdash;but
we&rsquo;re afraid he did something to her first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So our first duty is to find this Tom Adams,&rdquo;
announced the detective, rising. &ldquo;Can you take
us over to the farm now, Ditmar? Or rather, just
one of us, for the other two better stay here and
investigate that threat. And we want a picture of
Miss Mary Louise Gay. We&rsquo;ll get one of Adams
and print them both in every newspaper in the
country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not the only clue we&rsquo;ll work on,&rdquo;
put in another of the men. &ldquo;That may be entirely
wrong, and Miss Gay may just have met with an
accident, or even lost her memory. There are
many cases of that, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay nodded. That was just the trouble:
so many dreadful things might have happened
to Mary Louise!</p>
<p>However, she resolved to keep up her spirits
until she actually heard bad news. She could endure
the tension in the daytime, she thought, by
keeping herself active; perhaps, before night,
her husband would come.</p>
<p>So she hunted out some pictures of Mary
Louise for the detectives and answered their
questions for an hour. Just as the two men left to
go to Ditmars, to investigate the threat and
guard Adelaide, the roar of an airplane in the
sky drew Mrs. Gay&rsquo;s attention. It was an auto-giro,
fluttering over a near-by field where there
did not happen to be any trees.</p>
<p>Breathlessly she waited while it made its landing.
But the motor did not stop, and only one
man got out of the cockpit. Then, as the auto-giro
speeded away, the man on the field began to
run towards Shady Nook. In another moment
she identified him as her husband&mdash;Detective
Gay, of the police force!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>He took the porch steps two at a time and, out
of breath as he was, lifted his trembling wife
into his arms. For the first time since the disaster
Mrs. Gay broke down and sobbed. But what
a relief it was to give way to her feelings at last!
Her husband shared her anguish and understood,
comforting her as best he could with
words of assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find her, dear, I&rsquo;m sure we will!&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Mary Lou isn&rsquo;t a baby: she&rsquo;ll show lots of
pluck and courage. I&rsquo;m counting on that daughter
of ours every time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any plans at all, dear?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Lots. I&rsquo;m going to do a lot of telegraphing
as soon as I get the whole story. I was never
so thankful before that I&rsquo;d chosen the detective
profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had anything to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay smiled. &ldquo;Now that you mention it, I
don&rsquo;t believe I have. You might fix me some coffee
while you tell me just what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Freckles and Jane returned while Mr. Gay
was eating his meal, but they had nothing to report.
Hattie was sure that Tom could not be
guilty; she believed that he was running away
from his gambling debts. Nevertheless, she had
consented immediately to a thorough search of
the house and barn for the missing girl. Yet even
Silky&rsquo;s sharp nose could not find her.</p>
<p>The boy was delighted to find his father at
home; he felt immediately that a great weight
had been lifted from his shoulders. For, like
Mary Louise, he believed that his father could
almost accomplish the impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going over to the other shore after
lunch&mdash;with Silky,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and hunt some
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Son,&rdquo; approved Mr. Gay.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never give up till we find Mary Lou!&rdquo;</p>
<p>None of the other searchers returned with any
news all that afternoon. The day was hot and
sultry, and to Mrs. Gay, interminable. Everything
was so strangely quiet at the little resort;
no radios played, no young people shouted to
each other or burst into singing. Even the birds
seemed hushed, as if they too sensed the tragedy
of the usually happy little colony.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon the four girls who were
working at the Ditmars&rsquo; went into the river to
cool off with a swim, and Mr. Gay decided to
join them. But it was more like a bath than a
swim, and nobody seemed to enjoy it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Mr. Gay dressed and joined his wife on the
porch, waiting for the detectives to return. Suddenly
a noisy car came towards them&mdash;a bright
green roadster which was somehow familiar yet
did not belong at Shady Nook. It was dusty and
dirty; its two occupants wore goggles, as if they
had been participating in a race, and until they
spoke neither of the Gays recognized them.
Then they identified them instantly as Max
Miller and Norman Wilder, from Riverside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news yet?&rdquo; demanded Max eagerly as
he jumped out of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a bit,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gay. &ldquo;How did
you boys find out about it? Is it in the papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the afternoon edition,&rdquo; replied Norman,
handing a newspaper to the other. &ldquo;But of
course we started before that. There was a wire
to the Riverside police last night, that we got
wind of. So we started early this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s fine of you both to come,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Gay, though she could not at the moment
see what possible help they might afford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a swim, clean up our
car, and eat,&rdquo; announced Max; &ldquo;then we&rsquo;re going
to drive all around here within a radius of a
hundred miles, tooting our horn and going
slowly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you boys knew how to drive
slowly,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Gay teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we really won&rsquo;t need to toot our horn,&rdquo;
returned Norman in the same light manner, &ldquo;because
the color of our car is loud enough to
shriek for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mabel and Sue Reed, passing by the bungalow
on their way back to the Ditmars&rsquo;, stopped
in and met the boys. Mrs. Gay asked them to put
two extra places at the dinner table for them.</p>
<p>Gradually the searchers returned&mdash;without
any success&mdash;and everybody went to Ditmars to
dinner. It was a lovely meal. Adelaide Ditmar
proved that she knew how to prepare food and
serve it attractively, and, in spite of their anxiety,
everybody enjoyed it. Everybody except
Mrs. Gay, who could only pick at her food.</p>
<p>True to their resolve, Max and Norman drove
off in their car immediately after supper, with
Freckles and Jane along with them. The rest of
the inhabitants of Shady Nook settled down to
a quiet evening of waiting. Waiting and hoping
for news.</p>
<p>About eight o&rsquo;clock Mr. and Mrs. Frazier
came over from the hotel to offer their sympathy
to the Gays.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to alarm you, Gay,&rdquo; said
Frazier, &ldquo;but I think you haven&rsquo;t given enough
thought to the river. Mary Louise was playing
tennis on our court early in the afternoon, and
the most natural thing in the world would be for
her to take a swim afterwards. You know yourself
that even the best of swimmers have
cramps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay clutched her husband&rsquo;s arm tightly
in an effort to control herself. What a horrible
suggestion!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible as it is, drowning is better than lots
of things that might happen,&rdquo; remarked Mrs.
Frazier.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gay glared at the woman with hatred in
her eyes. How could she sit there and talk like
that? She rose abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to excuse us now, Mrs. Frazier,&rdquo;
she said unsteadily. &ldquo;My husband and I have
things to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hotelkeeper and his wife got up from
their chairs just as the detectives&rsquo; car stopped at
the bungalow. Everybody waited tensely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No news of your daughter, Mrs. Gay,&rdquo; announced
one of the detectives, immediately. &ldquo;But
we are on Adams&rsquo; trail. He&rsquo;s been spotted, speeding
across the country in a stolen car. This
afternoon they found the car, abandoned near a
woods. Undoubtedly he&rsquo;s guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frazier&rsquo;s white face became even more pasty-looking.
Nobody noticed it, except Mr. Gay,
who made it his business to watch people&rsquo;s reactions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I may say something,&rdquo; put in the hotelkeeper,
looking straight at the detective, &ldquo;I think
you&rsquo;re on the wrong track. Adams is guilty of a
small theft&mdash;he stole two hundred dollars from
me, and he left some gambling debts. That&rsquo;s why
he&rsquo;s running away. But I believe your real
criminal is right here at Shady Nook!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded all the detectives at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditmar. Horace Ditmar. These fires have
proved to be a good thing for him. Ditmars took
over all that boarding-house trade after Flicks&rsquo;
Inn burned down. Mary Louise was on the inside,
so they were probably afraid she&rsquo;d find out
too much&mdash;and&mdash;disposed of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Gay
angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d trust both Adelaide and Horace
anywhere. And how about that threat they got?
You saw that?&rdquo; she asked the detectives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was just a clever trick,&rdquo; explained
Frazier lightly, &ldquo;to throw off suspicion. You
notice it has not been carried out!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>Almost in hysterics, Mrs. Gay felt that she
could not bear those dreadful Fraziers another
minute. Desperately she clung to her husband&rsquo;s
arm for support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you men come inside?&rdquo; suggested Mr.
Gay, realizing how his wife was suffering.
&ldquo;Good-night, Mrs. Frazier. Good-night, Frazier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so another long night passed without any
news of Mary Louise. But it was not so terrible
for Mrs. Gay as the first one, because her husband
was with her. And Max Miller and Norman
Wilder comforted her with the assurance
that they were going to find Mary Louise the
following day.</p>
<p>Somehow, by intuition, perhaps, Mrs. Gay believed
them!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><i>Release</i></h2>
<p>While her parents and her friends at Shady
Nook were imagining all sorts of horrors for
Mary Louise, the day actually passed peacefully
for her. It was a terrible shock to waken
up in that bare little bedroom with the iron bars
at the window, but after the first realization of
it was over, she found comfort in work. For, unlike
the previous night, she was not allowed to
be idle.</p>
<p>Miss Stone came in at seven o&rsquo;clock with a
tray of breakfast in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you feel today, dear?&rdquo; she inquired
cheerfully.</p>
<p>Mary Louise opened sleepy eyes and looked
about her, trying to remember where she was.
For one ghastly moment she felt as if she would
scream as the horror of the whole thing came
back to her. But, realizing that such an act would
only help to confirm her nurse&rsquo;s belief in her insanity,
she managed to control herself. The sun
was shining, Miss Stone was kind&mdash;surely Mary
Louise would find a way out. So she smiled back
at the woman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, Miss Stone,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Am I supposed
to get dressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat your breakfast first,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;After today you&rsquo;ll probably eat with the other
patients. But the doctor is coming in to make an
examination this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded. &ldquo;And then what do I
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tidy up your own room and then take
some part in the household duties. You may have
your choice of cleaning, cooking, washing
dishes, or sewing. Then you&rsquo;ll eat lunch in the
dining room and spend an hour outdoors in the
garden. After that there is a rest period, when
you may read or sew, if you like. We have a
small library, and there is a class in knitting too,
if you prefer. Then supper&mdash;and vespers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds fine&mdash;so much better than doing
nothing,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;I think for my
particular work I&rsquo;ll choose cooking. I&rsquo;m pretty
good at cakes and pies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice, dear,&rdquo; concluded Miss Stone,
turning towards the door. &ldquo;Be ready to see the
doctor in about an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;May I have a shower?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll come back in fifteen minutes to take
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not a baby!&rdquo; protested Mary Louise.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite used to giving myself baths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, dear, but it&rsquo;s a rule. Sometimes patients
drown themselves if we don&rsquo;t watch them.
Maybe&mdash;later on&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish the sentence, but left the
room, locking the door behind her. It was very
like a nightmare, Mary Louise thought, as she
picked up her tray&mdash;a dream in which you found
yourself locked up somewhere without any
means of escape. But she meant to get away just
the same, if she had to climb that ten-foot wall
to accomplish it!</p>
<p>She decided immediately that she would be
an exemplary patient, that she would work hard
and do everything she was told to do. Gradually,
perhaps, her liberty would be increased as
the attendants learned that she could be trusted.</p>
<p>In spite of her blue calico uniform, Mary
Louise looked exceedingly pretty that morning
when the doctor came in to see her. Her cheeks
were glowing with perfect health, and her dark
eyes were smiling. The room, as well as her person,
was meticulously neat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>She identified the doctor immediately as the
man who had received her the day before at the
door of the institution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Miss Adams,&rdquo; he said, regarding
her with admiration. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking
well today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise. &ldquo;Only my
name doesn&rsquo;t happen to be Miss Adams,&rdquo; she
couldn&rsquo;t help adding.</p>
<p>The physician smiled, and she detected a
shade of pity in his expression. Something like
that in Miss Stone&rsquo;s face when she had humored
that patient by calling her &ldquo;Joan of Arc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he made no reply and went ahead with
the examination. When Miss Stone returned he
told her that Miss Adams was in perfect physical
condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the brain,&rdquo; thought Mary Louise in
secret amusement. How often she and her young
friends had made that remark to each other! She
resolved never to speak jokingly of insanity
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>After the doctor&rsquo;s visit her day proceeded in
the orderly manner which Miss Stone had outlined.
She cooked and washed dishes and ate
lunch with the patients. Then she went out in
the garden, where she was assigned a flower bed
of her own.</p>
<p>But Mary Louise was not interested in flower
beds at the moment. She pretended to work, all
the while looking about her at the grounds
around the asylum, at the high stone wall below
and into the valley beyond. Across this valley,
on a level with the institution, she could see a
white road that ran like a ribbon along the hill
in the distance. This road, she decided, must be
a main highway, or at least a drive frequented
by automobiles&mdash;otherwise it would not be so
smooth and white....</p>
<p>Staring at this road in silence, an inspiration
came to Mary Louise. An idea that might bring
about her longed-for release!</p>
<p>She waited eagerly for the nurse to come over
to where she was working, but she was careful
to keep her tone matter-of-fact when she did
make her request. Miss Stone must not guess her
hidden purpose!</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I break off two sticks from some bush?&rdquo;
she asked indifferently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to practice my
semaphore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, dear?&rdquo; inquired Miss Stone
skeptically. &ldquo;Is it anything dangerous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. It&rsquo;s just part of a Girl Scout&rsquo;s training.
You&rsquo;ve heard of Girl Scouts, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe I have. Anyway, I&rsquo;ve heard of
Boy Scouts, so I suppose the Girl Scouts is an
organization like theirs&mdash;for girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Mary Louise. &ldquo;And I
have always been very much interested in it. I
don&rsquo;t want to forget all that I have learned. So
if I had a couple of sticks and a needle and
thread, I could make a pair of flags and&mdash;and&mdash;practice
every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She uttered the last sentence haltingly, fearful
lest Miss Stone might guess her reason for
wanting them and refuse. But as the nurse had
no idea that semaphore meant signaling messages,
she was entirely unsuspicious. And it had
always been her policy to humor her patients
in pursuit of any harmless amusements.</p>
<p>So that afternoon she brought Mary Louise
needles and cotton and scissors and sat with her
while she cut up her red-and-white sports dress
for the flags. It seemed a pity, Miss Stone
thought, to destroy such a pretty dress, but it was
not likely that Mary Louise would ever need it
again. It was a sad fact that few of their patients
ever returned to the outside world!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Mary Louise finished her flags just before
supper and laid them carefully away behind the
washstand. Tomorrow&mdash;oh, happy thought!&mdash;she
would try her luck.</p>
<p>Hope is indeed a great tonic. Mary Louise
went right to sleep that night and slept soundly
until morning. She performed her duties so
quickly and with such intelligence that even
Miss Stone began to wonder whether there had
not been some mistake in confining the girl to
the institution. But as they did not take a daily
paper at the asylum, and as they were entirely
cut off from the outside world, she had no way
of knowing about the desperate search that was
going on all over the country for Mary Louise
Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that I have finished my work, may I
go out into the garden and practice my semaphore
for an hour before lunch?&rdquo; the girl asked
her nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; agreed Miss Stone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
with you, because I want to spray the rose
bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise was not so pleased to be accompanied,
but after all, Miss Stone&rsquo;s presence
would mean freedom from other attendants.
Nobody would molest her while her own nurse
was with her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>She selected a spot high up on the terrace,
from whence she could plainly see the ribbon of
white road across the valley. Then she began to
signal her message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I AM MARY LOUISE GAY. HELP!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over and over again she repeated the same
letters, hope coming into her heart each time a
car swung into view, despair taking possession
of her when it failed to stop. Perhaps, she
thought, she was too far away to be seen. She
glanced behind her, at the green bushes, and
moved along where she might have the gray
wall of the institution for her background. Red
and white should show up brilliantly in contrast
to somber gray.</p>
<p>Half an hour passed, during which perhaps a
dozen cars went by without stopping, and Mary
Louise&rsquo;s arms became weary. But she did not
give up. Sometimes, she was certain, one of her
own friends&rsquo; cars would come over that hill&mdash;and
stop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Miss Stone, watching the girl out of the corner
of her eye, nodded sadly to herself. She must
be crazy after all, she decided, to go through
that silly routine over and over again. Intelligent
on most subjects as she had discovered
Mary Louise to be, she must be unbalanced on
this particular obsession.</p>
<p>Still Mary Louise went on trying.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I AM MARY LOUISE GAY. HELP!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>she signaled again, for the twenty-fourth time,
as a small, bright car appeared on the road.</p>
<p>The car was proceeding very slowly; it
looked as if it could scarcely climb the hill.
Then, to the girl&rsquo;s intense joy, she watched it
stop. Perhaps it was only because of a faulty
engine or a puncture&mdash;but&mdash;oh&mdash;it was stopping!</p>
<p>Her heart beat so fast and her hands trembled
so that she could hardly repeat the message.
But she forced herself to go through it
again. This might be her one chance&mdash;her vital
hope of escape!</p>
<p>She knew now what it must feel like to be
abandoned at sea and all at once to glimpse a
sail on the empty waters, bringing hope, and
rescue, and life&mdash;if it stopped. But, oh, the utter
despair if it continued on its course unheeding!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>Two figures which looked like little dwarfs in
the distance jumped out of the car and stood
still, evidently watching Mary Louise&rsquo;s motions.
Frantic with excitement, she spelled the message
again, this time very slowly, forming the letters
carefully and pausing a long second between
each word:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I AM MARY LOUISE GAY. HELP
HELP HELP!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two tiny figures waited until she had finished
and then waved their arms frantically.</p>
<p>She watched them in feverish anguish as they
returned to the car and took something from the
back of it. For five long minutes they busied
themselves in some way which she could not
understand, while she waited, tense with emotion.</p>
<p>Miss Stone strolled over and spoke to her,
startling her so that she almost dropped her
flags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired, dear?&rdquo; inquired the nurse sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; protested Mary Louise. &ldquo;Let me
stay fifteen minutes more. Please!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>Her eyes were still fixed upon the car across
the valley. One of the men was stepping away
from it now, holding up both arms, which
waved two dark flags. Made from clothing, perhaps,
on the spur of the moment. And then he
began to signal.</p>
<p>Breathlessly Mary Louise watched the letters
as they came, spelling out words that brought
floods of joy to her heart. Overwhelming her
with happiness such as she had never known before.
For the message which she read was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;WE ARE COMING MARY LOU.
MAX AND NORMAN.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great tears of bliss rushed to her eyes and
rolled down her cheeks; her hands trembled,
and her arms grew limp. In the exhaustion of
her relief she dropped down weakly to the
ground.</p>
<p>Miss Stone came and bent over her anxiously,
fearing that some curious spell had come over
Mary Louise. A fit, perhaps, which would explain
why her brother had wished to confine this
girl in the asylum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you up, dear,&rdquo; the nurse said, &ldquo;and
we&rsquo;ll go into the house. You had better lie down
for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m all right!&rdquo; exclaimed Mary Louise,
jumping happily to her feet. &ldquo;My friends are
coming for me, Miss Stone!&rdquo; She threw her
arms around the woman and hugged her. &ldquo;Two
boys from my home town&mdash;in Riverside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, dear,&rdquo; agreed Miss Stone, sure now
that Mary Louise was raving. &ldquo;But come inside
now and rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to rest,&rdquo; objected the girl.
&ldquo;You said I could stay out till lunch, and there&rsquo;s
still ten minutes left. I want to wait for Max and
Norman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, dear, if you&rsquo;ll promise to calm
yourself. Sit down there on the step while I finish
these rose bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise did as she was told, keeping her
eyes fixed on the gate, wondering how long it
would take for the boys to get across that valley,
hoping that they wouldn&rsquo;t get lost. She picked
up her home-made flags and touched them lovingly.
&ldquo;Suppose I had never joined the Girl
Scouts&mdash;and suppose I had never become an expert
signaler!&rdquo; she thought. She shivered at the
very idea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>She did not have to wait long, however. In
less than ten minutes she saw the gardener unlock
the big iron gate and a dear, familiar green
roadster speed up the hill and stop at the door
of the asylum. In an instant both boys were out
of the car. Max was the first to reach Mary
Louise. Without any question of permission, he
took her into his arms and kissed her again and
again. Then Norman kissed her too, not quite so
ardently as Max.</p>
<p>Finally she freed herself laughingly from
their embraces and introduced them to Miss
Stone. The boys looked questioningly at the
woman. If she had been responsible for the kidnaping
of Mary Louise, why was the girl so
polite to her?</p>
<p>Max took a revolver from his pocket, just to
be prepared in case of violence.</p>
<p>Mary Louise laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need that, Max,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Miss
Stone won&rsquo;t do anything desperate. She is a
nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nurse? Is this a hospital?&rdquo; Alarm crept
into Max&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Oh, Mary Lou, you&rsquo;re not
hurt, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not a bit. Don&rsquo;t you know what kind of
place this is, Max? It&rsquo;s an asylum for the insane!
I&rsquo;m supposed to be crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horrified, Max sprang forward and seized
Miss Stone by the arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of diabolical plot is this?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Whose accomplice are you?&rdquo; He
pulled a newspaper out of his pocket and shook
it in the nurse&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;The whole country&rsquo;s frantic
over the disappearance of Mary Louise
Gay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Stone gazed at the picture in the paper
with increasing fear. Had she&mdash;and the rest of
the staff at the asylum&mdash;been accomplices to a
hideous crime?</p>
<p>But Mary Louise replied for her reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Stone&rsquo;s innocent, Max,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;Please let her go. So are the others here.
They&rsquo;re just obeying orders. Tom Adams put
me in here, calling me his feeble-minded sister
Rebecca. He really does happen to have one,
you may have heard, and I understand her
papers for confinement were filed once before.
Mr. Frazier signed my commitment too, pretending
to be a cousin. Those two men are the
only guilty ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Adams!&rdquo; repeated Max and Norman
at the same time, and Norman added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what Freckles said. They&rsquo;re looking
for Tom Adams. He ran away from Shady
Nook&mdash;or wherever it is he lives. The police
are after him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about Frazier?&rdquo; demanded Mary
Louise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he guilty?&rdquo; asked Max.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More so than Tom,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;Oh, I
must get back to tell the police before Frazier
sneaks away!&rdquo; She turned to the nurse. &ldquo;May I
go with the boys now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to ask the doctor,&rdquo; replied Miss
Stone, hurrying inside to the office.</p>
<p>It took no persuasion at all, however, to obtain
the doctor&rsquo;s consent. As soon as he read the
account in the newspaper and saw that Tom
Adams was a fugitive from the law, he gladly
agreed to let Mary Louise go free. In fact, he
was anxious that she should, lest he be blamed
for participation in the crime.</p>
<p>So Mary Louise jumped into the car between
the two boys, and in less than an hour she saw
the dear familiar trees of Shady Nook in the distance.
As the car approached her own bungalow,
she could distinguish her mother&mdash;yes, and
her father&mdash;sitting on the porch in an attitude
of hopeless despair.</p>
<p>Oh, what fun it was going to be to surprise
them so joyfully!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><i>Return</i></h2>
<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Gay looked up disconsolately
as the green car approached. Suddenly
their expressions of listlessness changed to incredulity&mdash;then
to rapture. Mary Louise was
home!</p>
<p>In another second the girl had flown up the
steps and was hugging both parents at once.
Mrs. Gay could only gasp in her happiness. It
was Mr. Gay who asked his daughter whether
she was unhurt and unharmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine!&rdquo; returned Mary Louise joyfully.
&ldquo;And, oh, so happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; murmured her mother, her voice
choked with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now praise these wonderful boys,&rdquo; insisted
the girl. &ldquo;My rescuers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max and Norman tried to look modest and
to wave aside their accomplishment with a gesture.
But Mr. Gay seized their hands in a fervor
of gratitude.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find words to tell you what it means
to us!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You two boys have succeeded
where four professional detectives failed. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
marvelous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t anything at all, except persistence
on our part,&rdquo; explained Max. &ldquo;The real
credit goes to Mary Lou. It was a swell idea she
had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What idea?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signaling for help. With semaphore flags&mdash;just
as we all used to do in the Scouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where were you, Mary Lou?&rdquo; asked her
father. &ldquo;Sit down and tell us all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First tell me whether you&rsquo;re hungry,&rdquo; put in
her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not specially,&rdquo; replied Mary Louise.
&ldquo;They fed us pretty well at the insane asylum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was fun to watch her parents&rsquo; startled expressions
at this announcement&mdash;fun now that
the experience was all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insane asylum!&rdquo; they both repeated in horror.
And then for the first time they noticed her
blue calico dress.</p>
<p>Mary Louise nodded and proceeded to tell
her story. Briefly and quickly, for she remembered
that she wanted to catch the two criminals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Has Mr. Frazier run away too?&rdquo; she inquired,
when she had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s over at his hotel,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gay.
&ldquo;I saw him this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must arrest him, Daddy!&rdquo; cried the girl.
&ldquo;He was the cause of the three fires at Shady
Nook. I know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you know, Mary Lou?&rdquo; asked
her father. &ldquo;What proof have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I overheard him and Tom Adams talking in
the hotel garage. They didn&rsquo;t actually mention
fires, but I&rsquo;m sure they meant them. I have their
conversation down in my notebook. I left it in
my desk. It&rsquo;s probably still there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Gay, &ldquo;that you tell
us the story of your suspicions&mdash;and clues&mdash;from
the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I&rsquo;m getting lunch,&rdquo; added Mrs. Gay.</p>
<p>Mary Louise ran into her bedroom and found
the little notebook. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just change my dress,&rdquo;
she called laughingly, &ldquo;and be with you in a
minute.... But tell me where Jane and
Freckles are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out hunting for you. With Silky!&rdquo; was the
reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>A couple of minutes later she returned to the
porch, looking more like herself in her own
modern clothing. She sat down on the swing and
opened her notebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I first suspected Tom Adams the day after
Flicks&rsquo; Inn burned down,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;All of
the people of Shady Nook were over on the little
island that night on a picnic, and Hattie
Adams told me she expected to have Tom take
her. But he wasn&rsquo;t anywhere to be found. And
the boys saw a big fellow in the woods who answered
his description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I sort of gave up the idea of his being
guilty when I heard he had lost some work by
Flicks&rsquo; Inn burning down. It threw me off the
track for a while; I really suspected his feeble-minded
sister Rebecca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Smiths&rsquo; house caught fire, and
Rebecca gave us a warning&mdash;so I suspected her
all the more. Finding that pack of Cliff&rsquo;s cards
in the can of water didn&rsquo;t prove a thing to me.
I never believed he was guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was absurd to arrest him,&rdquo; commented
Mr. Gay. &ldquo;The blundering idiot who caused
it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s laugh ran out merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Jane will have to get together,
Dad,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You agree so perfectly about
David McCall!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never did care for the fellow,&rdquo; her father
muttered. &ldquo;Give me men with brains&mdash;and
sense!&rdquo; He looked admiringly at Max and Norman.
&ldquo;But get on with the story, Mary Lou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the day after the Smiths&rsquo; fire that I
really seriously suspected Tom Adams,&rdquo; she
continued. &ldquo;I trailed him to the store at Four
Corners and found him gambling. He told a
man that he&rsquo;d pay him a hundred dollars, which
he expected to collect immediately. And that set
me thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; inquired Max.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because a farmhand doesn&rsquo;t earn a hundred
dollars so easily, especially from tightwads like
Frazier. Everybody knows that man pays miserable
wages.... Then, besides that, I overheard
Tom Adams explaining a card trick, and
that fact made me guess that he had gotten hold
of one of Cliff&rsquo;s decks of cards and either accidentally
or purposely dropped them at the
Smiths&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gay nodded approvingly. He loved to
watch the logical working of his daughter&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So I began to put two and two together,&rdquo; she
went on. &ldquo;Somebody was paying Tom a lot of
money&mdash;lots more than a hundred dollars, I
learned&mdash;for doing something. What, I asked
myself, could the job be except setting those
houses on fire? And who wanted them burned
down except Frazier, or possibly Horace Ditmar,
who, as you know, is an architect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you narrowed your suspects down to two
people&mdash;besides Tom Adams?&rdquo; inquired Mr.
Gay admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And when Adelaide Ditmar got that
threat I was positive Frazier was responsible.
He wanted the business, and he was doing
everything he could to get it. But even then I
had no proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what did you do?&rdquo; asked Max. &ldquo;And why
did Tom Adams suspect that you knew anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all because of this conversation,&rdquo; answered
Mary Louise, opening her notebook. &ldquo;I
overheard it near Frazier&rsquo;s garage, and then I
was stupid enough to let them see me. I even
told them I was going over to the farm to talk to
Hattie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a mistake,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Gay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A mistake I paid for pretty dearly,&rdquo; agreed
the girl. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all right now, so it really
doesn&rsquo;t matter.... Now let me read you the
conversation between Frazier and Tom Adams
on the afternoon I was taken away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly, in the words of the two men, she
read to her listeners of Tom&rsquo;s demand for money
and Mr. Frazier&rsquo;s reluctant compliance with
his claims. When she had finished she looked
eagerly at her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Frazier guilty?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;s guilty,&rdquo; agreed the detective.
&ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t ever admit it. He&rsquo;ll squirm out of
it, because we haven&rsquo;t got proof in so many
words. He&rsquo;ll say he was talking about something
entirely different to Tom Adams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t he be arrested?&rdquo; persisted Mary
Louise, a note of disappointment creeping into
her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how&mdash;until we find Tom Adams.
He&rsquo;ll establish Frazier&rsquo;s guilt, all right. I can&rsquo;t
see Adams shouldering the blame alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise frowned; she hated the idea of
the hotelkeeper&rsquo;s freedom, even though it might
be only temporary. But suddenly her face
lighted up with inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He can be arrested
for signing that paper confining me to the insane
asylum, can&rsquo;t he, Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>Mr. Gay looked startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What paper?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Mary Louise explained that, since the commitment
had to be signed by two relatives of the
patient, Mr. Frazier had posed as her cousin.
That was enough, Mr. Gay said immediately:
all that they needed as evidence was the paper itself.
They would drive over to the institution
that afternoon and secure it.</p>
<p>Luncheon was indeed a happy meal in the
Gay household that day. Although Freckles and
Jane did not return, the two boys and Mary
Louise kept up a constant banter of laughter and
merriment. Mr. and Mrs. Gay were quieter, but
a light of rapture shone in their eyes.</p>
<p>Just at the conclusion of the meal Mrs.
Hunter and Cliff arrived. Prepared to enter a
house of misery and fear, they could not believe
their ears as they heard the gayety from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Lou!&rdquo; cried Cliff incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cliff!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, jumping up and
running to the screen door. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re home!&rdquo; returned the young man,
seizing both of her hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>In spite of his arrest, Clifford Hunter was the
same care-free young person. In a few minutes
he was showing his card tricks to Max and Norman,
delighted to find a new audience.</p>
<p>When the whole story had been retold to the
Hunters, with the caution that they say nothing
of it to Mr. Frazier, Mary Louise and the three
boys walked around the little resort to tell everybody
there the glad news. Then she and her
father and Max took the car and drove to the
Adams farm. Mr. Gay thought it would be wise
to take old Mr. Adams with them to visit the
asylum, and Mary Louise thought it would be
interesting to bring Rebecca&mdash;just to let Miss
Stone and the other attendants meet the real
Rebecca Adams!</p>
<p>With Max at the wheel they had no difficulty
in finding the asylum. What fun it was, Mary
Louise thought, to pass through those iron gates
now&mdash;knowing that she was safe! Yet instinctively
she reached for her father&rsquo;s hand and held
it securely as the car proceeded up the long
driveway.</p>
<p>The same doctor and the same head nurse
came out to receive them as upon Mary Louise&rsquo;s
first visit. Mr. Gay displayed his badge at once
and explained his errand. The woman nodded
and hurried into the office for the paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>While she was gone, Rebecca Adams, growing
restless, stepped out of the car, lugging her
heavy water pitcher in her arms. At the same
moment Miss Stone, Mary Louise&rsquo;s special
nurse, came out of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Stone, I want you to meet the real
Rebecca Adams,&rdquo; said Mary Louise, with a
twinkle in her eye.</p>
<p>Rebecca turned eagerly to the nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you show me where there is a well of
clear water?&rdquo; she asked immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Miss Stone gravely. &ldquo;Back of
the building. We have a fine well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the woman in ecstasy. &ldquo;At last!&rdquo;
She looked over at her father, and there were
tears of earnestness in her eyes. &ldquo;Let me stay
here, Father! This is my home, where I want to
live!&rdquo; Her voice grew more wistful. &ldquo;A well of
clear water!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Please take me to
it, kind lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is for the best,&rdquo; agreed old Mr.
Adams. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody to take good care of
Rebecca at home now that her mother&rsquo;s dead
and I&rsquo;m crippled up with rheumatism. She can
stay if she wants to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>And so, at her own request, Rebecca Adams
took up her life at the quiet institution, and the
rest of the party, with the paper which was to be
used as evidence against Frazier in their hands,
drove back to Shady Nook.</p>
<p>Mary Louise went into her bedroom and put
on her prettiest dress, awaiting the arrival of
Jane and Freckles and her friends. What a
glorious evening it was going to be for them all!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br /><i>Conclusion</i></h2>
<p>Mary Louise was putting the last dabs of
powder on her nose when she heard a car stop
at the porch steps. Peering through the screened
window of her bedroom she immediately decided
that it must be the detectives. Yes&mdash;and,
oh, joy of joys!&mdash;they had Tom Adams with
them!</p>
<p>In another moment the men were out of the
car and up on the porch, where her father
joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Gay. &ldquo;I
see that you got Tom Adams. I remember him
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered one of the men. &ldquo;But he
won&rsquo;t admit a thing about your daughter. He
says he never saw Mary Louise after she went
back to the tennis court that afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what grounds could you arrest him,
then?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stole a car on his way to the West.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>Mary Louise repressed a giggle and turned
away from the window. Her father evidently
meant to find out what he could before he
announced his daughter&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a sister Rebecca, haven&rsquo;t you,
Adams?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>The young man nodded. &ldquo;Yes. She&rsquo;s feeble-minded.
Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that Mary Louise saw her the
afternoon she disappeared. Rebecca told us so,
and she also said that you came home that afternoon
just as my daughter started to leave the
farm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rebecca&rsquo;s mind wanders a lot,&rdquo; muttered
Tom. &ldquo;She don&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s talkin&rsquo; about
half the time.&rdquo; He shifted his feet uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;have been thinking of putting Rebecca
into an asylum?&rdquo; persisted Mr. Gay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. We considered it. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she&rsquo;s in one now,&rdquo; announced Mr.
Gay calmly. &ldquo;Of her own free will. An asylum
about twenty miles from here. A Dr. Fetter, I
believe, is the head of the institution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and gazed intently at Tom. The
young man&rsquo;s jaw dropped, his face grew white,
and his hands trembled.</p>
<p>Mr. Gay burst out laughing, and Mary
Louise came to the screen door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Tom,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>
<p>The young man started as if he had seen a
ghost. But he managed to stammer a reply.
&ldquo;Hello, Miss Gay,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>All three of the plainclothes men stepped forward
in amazement. &ldquo;You found her, Gay?&rdquo;
they demanded of Mary Louise&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Mr. Gay. &ldquo;To be frank, I
didn&rsquo;t. Two of her young friends from Riverside
did. She was confined in an insane asylum
about twenty miles from Shady Nook, under the
name of Rebecca Adams!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of Tom&rsquo;s pretence fell away from him at
this announcement. He knew his game was up.
His limbs grew weak; he groveled at the men&rsquo;s
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t send me to the chair!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t harm her. She&rsquo;s all right, ain&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let the judge and the jury decide that,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Gay. &ldquo;Now, suppose you sit down
there and tell us the truth, Adams. You might as
well, for we know most of it already!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man crawled into a seat, but he
made no attempt to tell his story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We know that you burned three houses here
at Shady Nook,&rdquo; said Mr. Gay. &ldquo;We know, too,
that you did it because you were bribed by
Frazier. Didn&rsquo;t he pay you a certain sum of
money to start those fires?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did,&rdquo; acknowledged Tom. &ldquo;He gave
me five hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he want them burned down?&rdquo;
asked one of the plainclothes men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He figured that he&rsquo;d get five hundred at least
from the Hunters during the summer, entertaining
their friends and all. Then Flicks&rsquo; fire
turned out to be better business yet. All the folks
from Shady Nook, except the Ditmars, begun
eatin&rsquo; at the hotel, once the inn was gone. And
Smiths&rsquo; burnin&rsquo; down brought all them children
and servants and even the Ma and Pa over to
the Royal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Frazier expect to burn any more cottages?&rdquo;
was the next question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he wasn&rsquo;t plannin&rsquo; on it. Only, when
Mrs. Ditmar started up a boardin&rsquo; house and
took his business away from him, that made him
sore. But I wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; a do no more dirty
work. I figured I&rsquo;d just get my money and clear
out. I never did expect to burn Ditmars&rsquo;&mdash;only
threaten &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what made you do that dreadful thing
to Mary Louise?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Gay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to get rid of her till I made my get-away.
Frazier and me was scared she was onto
somethin&rsquo; and would send for you, and you&rsquo;d
figure it all out, Mr. Gay. Frazier thought, if I
was gone, he&rsquo;d be safe. He&rsquo;d just deny everything.
The idea of callin&rsquo; Mary Louise &lsquo;Rebecca&rsquo;
just popped into my head when she told
us she was goin&rsquo; over to the farm to see Hattie
that afternoon. I knew Hattie and Dad was off
to the fair. So I jumped in my car and run over
to the asylum and made the arrangements. We
just got back in time to nab her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the men stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Detective Gay,&rdquo; he Said, &ldquo;I think you and I
had better go over and arrest Frazier now.
These other two men can take charge of
Adams.&rdquo; He turned to Mary Louise, who was
still standing in the doorway. &ldquo;Is there any question
you want to ask this criminal, Miss Gay,
before we take him away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mary Louise, stepping
through the doorway. &ldquo;I would like to know
how that pack of cards came to be dropped at
the Smiths&rsquo; the night of their fire&mdash;how Tom
happened to have them in his possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man flushed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One day I was watchin&rsquo; Hunter do a trick
on the hotel porch. I noticed he put the cards in
his coat pocket. Later on, he hung the coat over
the back of a chair while he went off to play tennis.
So I sneaked up and took &rsquo;em out of his
pocket, to use to show the trick to the boys. I
thought they was marked, but they wasn&rsquo;t.
Hunter sure is clever at tricks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then when I heard people was suspectin&rsquo;
him of burnin&rsquo; his own cottage down for the
insurance, I thought I might as well help that
suspicion along. So I dropped his pack of cards
into that can of water at the Smiths&rsquo;. And sure
enough, it worked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Louise&rsquo;s eyes were filled with contempt,
but she did not put her feeling into words. Instead,
she nodded to the detectives, and the men
all left the porch. Fifteen minutes later Frazier&rsquo;s
arrest was accomplished, and the three
plainclothes men started for Albany with both
criminals in their custody.</p>
<p>Mary Louise and her parents watched them
go with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; said her father, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if only Jane and Freckles would
come,&rdquo; added her mother, &ldquo;we could be perfectly
happy. It&rsquo;s time to go to dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>In a couple of minutes Mrs. Gay&rsquo;s wish was
granted. Down the road half a dozen young people
came running, for they had just heard the
wonderful news that Mary Louise was back.
Silky reached his mistress first, then Freckles
arrived, with Jane and four of the boys close behind.</p>
<p>Never, if she lived to be a hundred, would
Mary Louise forget that wonderful dinner at
the Ditmars&rsquo;. The joy of being back home again,
the happiness of her friends, the companionship
of her father&mdash;oh, everything seemed perfect
that night to the lovely brown-eyed girl. And
not least of it all was the satisfaction of knowing
that the mystery of the fires was solved at last!
Shady Nook was safe again for everybody&mdash;to
enjoy for many, many summers to come!</p>
